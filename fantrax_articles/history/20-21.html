<h1>EPL at a Glance</h1>
<p>COVID-19 continued to have a massive impact on the world and football. Most of the premier league season was played without fans in the stadiums. During the season it looked like the away team had a better chance of a win than the home team. Manchester City ran away with the league as their squad depth proved vital to the team's winning season.
