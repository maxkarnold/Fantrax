<h1>Season Preview: Draft Grades</h1>
<p>With the new season right around the corner, I thought it would be fun to analyze each team's draft and how they did. I've given each team a grade on each position, Forwards, Midfielders, Defenders, and Goalkeepers. I've ranked all the teams based on their draft.</p>
<p>Obviously, there will be some disagreement, but I had to pick some teams to be rated higher than others. I'll be going through the teams in alphabetical order.</p>
<h3>30 Yard Screamers</h3>
<p>To briefly overview 30 Yard Screamers' team, it is filled with a star-studded defense, with risky picks throughout the rest of the squad.</p>
<p>GK grade: B</p>
<p>He has a very solid goalkeeper in Schmeichel.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A+</p>
<p>His defense consists of Alexander-Arnold, Shaw, Veltman, Reguilon, Keane, and Aarons. This defense is incredible, with two players probably in the top 5 defenders, Shaw and Trent. He has a bold pick in Veltman, that is balanced by solid picks of Reguilon and Keane.</p>
<p>MID grade: C</p>
<p>Looking at his midfield, I start to question the team. He has El Ghazi, Pogba, Saka, Townsend, Bissouma, and Ziyech. Of all these players, the only definite starters for me are Saka and Bissouma. Bissouma is an average scorer and Saka is good, but not up with the upper echelon of midfielders. The only other potential starters for me are Townsend and Pogba. Townsend is a good fantasy asset but struggled for starts at Crystal Palace and now he'll be competing with Richarlison, Iwobi, and Gray. Pogba isn't likely to start right now, but if Manchester United sign a player like Ruben Neves that can be the sole holding midfielder, he has a much better chance to start.</p>
<p>FW grade: B-</p>
<p>Moving on to his forward line, he has Cavani, Sancho, Sterling, and Martial. With Cavani and Martial, he has a good pair that will score good points on their day. He has Sancho, who can also play in midfield and is a definite starter, but we have no idea what his fantasy output will be in his debut season. Finally, we have Sterling who has a place in the Manchester City team but now has more competition in Jack Grealish. Sterling is definitely favored by Pep and I don't see him leaving the team this summer. However, I wonder if Sterling will again be overshadowed by other Manchester City players</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 8th</p>
<h3>Afternoon De Ligt</h3>
<p>On first look, Afternoon De Ligt looks like a team that is a little heavy on forwards but otherwise has a fairly balanced team.</p>
<p>GK grade: A</p>
<p>In goal, he has Alisson. With a likely healthy defense and a resurgent season from Liverpool, I'd expect Alisson to return as one of the best keepers in Fantasy.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B</p>
<p>In defense, he has the options of Rudiger, Tarkowski, White, and Castagne. Although he has few defenders, these are a solid group of defenders with good potential. Rudiger is likely to continue to start for Chelsea and is perhaps their highest-scoring center-back with a great chance at clean sheets. Tarkowski is undoubtedly the best center-back in Fantasy and will look to continue again this season. White is likely to start for Arsenal and will most likely rotate on Afternoon De Ligt with Castagne as Leicester added to their already stellar wing-back options with Bertrand. This might push Castagne to the bench, although it's hard to tell as he's still coming back from an injury.</p>
<p>MID grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield options include Alli, Bruno Fernandes, Dallas, March, Rodri, Foden, and Willock. There are a few risky picks in this position, paired with some safer picks. Rodri, Bruno, and Dallas should be starters for most of the season. Although Rodri and Dallas have fairly low ceilings. March is potentially a risk, but that's only because he's been out of the team so long. March is a steal in the draft, should he start. Some more risky choices are Alli, Willock, and Foden. Willock is looking to be a starter for Newcastle, although is unlikely to start the season, while Foden is a very good player and will once again rotate with Manchester City's other options. Alli is probably the only question as it's been a long time since he's scored decent fantasy points even when starting. Overall the depth in midfield on this team makes up for some players not being regular starters.</p>
<p>FW grade: C+</p>
<p>The forwards for this team include Firmino, Pepe, Vardy, Jesus, and Zaha. A few risky picks in the forward line, with the only safe pick being Zaha. There are questions about age which might lead to less game time for both Vardy and Firmino, with younger strikers likely to get game time on both teams. Pepe had flashes of brilliance last season but remains out of favor with Arteta with his main competition the best player on Arsenal in Saka. Zaha is likely to play every game, but it's unknown how he'll do this season under a new manager. Jesus is one of the biggest question marks as he could be leaving Manchester City at the end of this transfer window or could be included as a solid rotation player in Pep's champions.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 5th</p>
<h3>Can You Digne It</h3>
<p>At first glance, this looks like a very good team. However, it looks like a team that looks too much on past form and is likely to disappoint.</p>
<p>GK grade: B+</p>
<p>In goal, Meslier was surprisingly one of the better keepers last season. He was a very boom or bust player, that could win or lose your team games.</p>
<p>DEF grade: C</p>
<p>The defense includes Ayling, Cresswell, Digne, Mings, Phillips, and Zouma. This defense is very suspect, other than Digne and Cresswell. Digne is a bonafide top 10 defender in the league. Cresswell was an excellent defender last season, but there are questions on whether he and West Ham will have better or worse seasons this year. Ayling is a decent defender but is not likely to score as many points as other defenders. Mings is a decent bench option that will likely start most of the season for Aston Villa. Phillips and Zouma are outright bad picks. Phillips was a defender that was used in an emergency situation last season with all the injuries, with the return of Van Dijk, Gomez, Matip, and the signing of Konate. Phillips is likely to be the fifth choice at center back for Liverpool. Zouma had a terrific start to last season but was the last-choice center back once Tuchel was in charge.</p>
<p>MID grade: A</p>
<p>The midfield includes Gro&szlig;, Harrison, Mount, Tielemans, Bernardo Silva, McGinn. This is undoubtedly the strongest aspect of the team. Mount is likely to have an even better season than last year with the arrival of Lukaku. Harrison is an outstanding player that is now fully committed to Leeds and is likely to get better. Gro&szlig; lost his place in Brighton's team at the beginning of the season but eventually gained it back. He'll still have some tough competition from new signing Mwepu and MacAllister, but he's likely to start. Tielemans and Mcginn are solid additions that will play every game and have the potential to be very solid midfielders. The only questionable player is Bernardo Silva, who has been linked with a move away from more than any other Manchester City player. Whether or not he will, Silva will definitely retain a bench role for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>FW grade: B+</p>
<p>The forward line includes Aubameyang, Mahrez, Mane, and Greenwood. This forward line is very interesting and if some of them are busts, it's not likely to be the end of the world. Mahrez will definitely get game time for Manchester City this season as will Mane. There are questions on Mane's performances last season and whether Jota should replace him, but he still managed to score 11.66 ppg last season. Greenwood is an up-and-coming star for Manchester United and this could very well be his breakout season where he takes the mantle from Cavani. The only suspect pick is Aubameyang who has continued to look awful with Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. Perhaps there's the potential that if Arsenal starts off so poorly, they'll fire Arteta and bring in a manager better suited for Aubamayeng. However, the likelihood of Arteta being fired seems low and there's no guarantee that Aubamayeng will regain his form. He's unlikely to start the season well and at best will have a better 2022.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 7th</p>
<h3>Gylfi Pleasures</h3>
<p>At first glance, Gylfi Pleasures is a team that doesn't look like it will finish bottom of the table but is also unlikely to reach the top. The team has a lot of safe picks, but might not be able to win every game.</p>
<p>GK grade: B</p>
<p>Mendy is a very good goalkeeper, but Chelsea's defense was so good at the end of last season, that he hardly made any saves. He's likely to produce the same numbers this season.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A-</p>
<p>This defense includes James, Robertson, Dias, Cash, and Fofana. Fofana is likely to be out for most of the season and is a huge loss for this team. However, the defense remains strong. Dias and Cash are definite starters for their respective clubs, with a decent average ppg. While Robertson is out with an injury at the beginning of the season, it looks like picking up a defender would be a good idea. James has been an excellent fantasy asset when starting, but it's hard to say how many games he'll start. Last season he shared time with Azpilicueta, although that mostly ended with the introduction of the back 3. In the past Hudson-Odoi has looked to be a decent option at RWB as well, so there is potential for James to lose his spot. However, it's unlikely that James will be removed from the position without the chance to compete for his spot. This means, that it's likely that Hudson-Odoi will come on as a substitute at RWB which shouldn't hurt him as much. The defenders are good, but the depth worries me.</p>
<p>MID grade: B+</p>
<p>The midfield includes Bowen, Maddison, Saint-Maximin, Smith Rowe, Lucas, and Phillips. This is a very deep midfield with options. However, there don't look to be any real star players. If Saint-Maximin and Maddison can stay healthy and Bowen can keep his starting role, I can see this team being in the top 4. However, these are all ifs and the other options are unlikely to have high ceilings. Smith Rowe and Phillips are unlikely to improve much more this season, while Lucas hasn't been able to consistently produce fantasy points.</p>
<p>FW grade: A-</p>
<p>The forward line includes Bailey, Calvert-Lewin, Kane, Torres, and Benteke. This is a risky forward line with injury-prone Kane and sleeper picks, Bailey and Benteke. However, both Bowen and Saint-Maximin can play as forwards which gives this team plenty of options. We all know Kane can be excellent as he was the second-highest scorer last season. Calvert-Lewin had a terrific start to last season while Benteke had a terrific end. Bailey is potentially a very decent starter for Aston Villa and Torres is likely to get more minutes this season. This forward line could go horribly wrong, but it's more likely to be one of the best in the league.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 2nd</p>
<h3>Maximum Arteta</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team is fairly balanced in each position but a lack of depth might hurt the team long-term.</p>
<p>GK grade: A</p>
<p>Nick Pope has solidly been one of the best goalkeepers in the premier league, the last five years. He only struggled when Burnley didn't have their top defenders Tarkowski and Mee fit.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A</p>
<p>This defense includes Coufal, Tierney, Wan-Bissaka, Firpo, Boly, and Lamptey. This defense looks very solid with good depth. Lamptey is likely to be out for a small period at the beginning of the season, but he and Boly are likely to have bounce-back campaigns this time around. Coufal and Wan-Bissaka are very solid picks, that both have the potential to be top 15 defenders. Tierney also has that potential, but plays for a horrible Arsenal team and has struggled with injuries throughout his career. Firpo is a new signing for Leeds from Barcelona and will not start right away, but is likely to be a very good addition. Overall the entire defense has upside but is likely to start off the season slow. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>MID grade: B</p>
<p>The midfield includes Armstrong, Grealish, Rodriguez, Soucek, and Thiago. The drafting of Eberechi Eze turned out to be a disaster as he was immediately dropped, which makes this midfield lack depth. There are question marks over many of the players as well. Armstrong and Rodriguez are excellent players but are likely to be playing for struggling teams. Grealish and Thiago are likely to fight for game time at their respective clubs but have high ceilings. Soucek was excellent last season, but it just seems unlikely that he'll score 10 goals again. The midfield would have been excellent last season but is unlikely to reach the same heights this season.</p>
<p>FW grade: B-</p>
<p>The forwards include Jota, Jimenez, Traore, Sarr. Perhaps not the strongest aspect of the team, there are a few question marks for the forwards. Jota will once again need to break into Liverpool's front three as the chemistry built between the three is so important to Liverpool. There is a possibility that they play a front four in some games to include all four, removing a midfielder. For Jimenez and Traore, it feels like the end of an era for Wolves and there are serious questions about whether this team can replicate their success under new manager Bruno Lage. Traore still has competition in the wide areas with players like Pedro Neto, Podence, and the loanee Trinc&atilde;o. With injuries to both Neto and Podence to start the season, Traore will be given the start at the beginning of the season but will he be able to keep his fantasy numbers up under a new manager. Jimenez meanwhile is coming back from a scary head injury that now means he must wear a helmet for the rest of his career. Jimenez is unlikely to replicate his excellent goal-scoring from before the injury and is also approaching 30. However, he seems like a fairly safe pick to start for Wolves considering how they suffered without him. Meanwhile, the young and talented Sarr has big upside although might have trouble scoring a ton with a weak Watford side.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 3rd</p>
<h3>Pretty Please with the Cherries on Top</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team feels fairly underwhelming with no real standout position. The forward line has a lot of players, but many of them have questions over them and are more likely to take up space than help the team. It's vital for this team for Heung-Min Son to do well.</p>
<p>GK grade: B+</p>
<p>One of the few teams that have two goalkeepers. Ederson and Pickford are not bad choices. However, I would never expect to bench Ederson unless injured. Therefore, I can ignore Pickford and focus on Ederson. Ederson is a fairly safe keeper and will always get points when Manchester City keeps a clean sheet. However, his lack of saves means that he's not going to be in the upper echelon of keepers.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A-</p>
<p>The defenders include Chilwell, Mee, Targett, and Doherty. This is a solid group of defenders that has three definite starters and one risky pick. If Doherty is the player that starts for Spurs more often than not, he could be one of the best defenders in the league. With three other defenders that can start, if Doherty doesn't work out this is a very good defense.</p>
<p>MID grade: C+</p>
<p>The midfield includes Barnes, Cantwell, Pulisic, Trossard, and Neves. Harvey Barnes highlights a group of underwhelming midfielders. Barnes could have an even better season than last year and is likely to have an excellent season. Cantwell and Trossard are both solid players that are still young as well. They are likely to be handicapped by the success of their own team as they look to battle relegation. Neves is a solid midfield option that will start all games but will not provide high numbers. Pulisic has the potential to score high in fantasy but is unlikely to find success with Chelsea. Lately, Pulisic has been tried out in the wing-back role and is likely to be behind Hudson-Odoi and James in that position. While upfront, he'll be behind Werner, Havertz, and the incoming Lukaku. Pulisic only has a chance to play if Chelsea suffers serious injuries. I'd expect him to be dropped early in the season.</p>
<p>FW grade: C+</p>
<p>The forwards for this team include Ings, Son, Wilson, Adams, Lacazette, and Pukki.</p>
<p>The amount of depth at the forward position is kind of frightening. Luckily, Son can play in midfield and will likely be played there. Wilson is probably the only star forward other than Son in this team. Wilson had a terrific campaign last season and it's hard to tell whether he'll repeat it. Wilson did well with the chances given to him but struggled with injuries. Wilson can do better if he stays fit all season, but I find that unlikely. The other forwards are likely to give one hit. Adams and Pukki are going to start the season as the main forwards for their team, however, they play for struggling sides. There is potential and at least will be able to start. Ings and Lacazette are potentially very smart draft picks, but also have the potential to bust. Ings has just been bought by Aston Villa, but there's no guarantee he'll replace the younger Watkins. Lacazette has been linked away to make room for another forward at Arsenal. If he was to stay he has competition from Aubamayeng, Martinelli, and the young Balogun. Lacazette was the top scorer from last season, so you'd think he has a good chance of starting. But it's still a question mark.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 9th</p>
<h3>Singapore Slingers</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team could be very good but has a lot of potential outcomes. If Brentford outperforms their expectations and Singapore Slingers can get their best players starting, this could be a top-half team.</p>
<p>GK grade: B-</p>
<p>Sanchez is a very average keeper in the league as expected from one of the last keepers picked in the draft. I don't expect him to do better or worse this season.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B+</p>
<p>The defense includes Cancelo, Pinnock, Thiago Silva, Aurier, Saiss, Zinchenko. This defense has a lot of question marks, with one superstar defender. Cancelo can be the best fantasy defender in the league, but because of rotation won't play every game. It was a smart pick to get Zinchenko to play when Cancelo isn't picked in the starting XI. Other than that, it's hard to predict that both Pinnock and Thiago Silva will be above-average defenders. Saiss didn't start the whole of last season and lost his place to Kilman, however, he gained his place back and is a very good fantasy defender. Aurier is a great fantasy asset but faces competition from the favored Doherty and youngster Tanganga. There is enough depth that enough of the defenders should work out.</p>
<p>MID grade: A-</p>
<p>This midfield includes Buendia, De Bruyne, Jorginho, Ndidi, and Lingard. While the defense lacks quality, the midfield lacks depth. De Bruyne, Buendia, and Ndidi are probably the best collection of midfielders in the league. However, the only other options are Jorginho and Lingard. Jorginho is a fairly safe pick to start in Tuchel's system, but he's a very boom or bust player. Lingard is unlikely to start for Manchester United barring serious injuries similar to Liverpool last season. His COVID-19 illness will likely bar him from a move to another team, although there is the off chance he is loaned to a team like West Ham at the last minute.</p>
<p>FW grade: A</p>
<p>The forward line includes Bamford, Iheanacho, Werner, Toney, and Neto. This is a scary forward line, that could become one of the best in the league. However, there are a few question marks surrounding these players. Bamford, Iheanacho, and Neto all had breakout seasons. There's a question as to whether they can improve or continue that form into this season. Neto and Bamford are likely to play most games they are fit for, while Iheanacho still has to compete for time with Vardy and new signing Patson Daka. Meanwhile, Brentford's main goalscoring threat, Ivan Toney, is an interesting draft pick. People might have questions as to whether he can replicate his form from the Championship to the Premier League. I believe he can and he will. Werner has had a strange season with Chelsea, putting up decent numbers for goals and assists but perhaps not what Chelsea fans were looking for. Now that Chelsea is signing Lukaku, the main question is who will start alongside him. If Werner starts most games, I'd expect a very good season from him. Either way, this forward is brimming with talent and a lot of goals between them. Even if Neto is out for a decent amount of 2021, the rest of the forwards can most likely carry the load.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 1st</p>
<h3>Team Akio</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team has a lot of balance with positions. It has a lot of good players, but I'm wondering if it has the right players to make it a playoff contender.</p>
<p>GK grade: A+</p>
<p>You can't get much better than Martinez in goal. Aston Villa is just getting better and goalkeepers like Martinez got a buff in our scoring system.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B</p>
<p>The defense includes Azpilicueta, Stones, van Dijk, Cooper, Dunk, and Romero. This is an interesting group of defenders as all of them can play center back. It's an interesting draft decision but might not be the worst. Center backs have been slightly buffed this season and he has some good ones. Stones and Van Dijk are likely to be two of the highest-scoring center-backs in the league. The same goes for Azpilicueta if he plays, but I believe that Chelsea will buy a center-back to replace Azpilicueta by the end of the window. Romero is Tottenham's marquee signing this season and it should be interesting to see how quickly he adapts to the Premier League from Serie A. I wouldn't bet on Romero producing starting number stats, so I'd say he's right for the bench. The same goes for Dunk and Cooper, who are both fairly old and unlikely to produce higher numbers than last season.</p>
<p>MID grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield includes Fornals, Gundogan, McNeil, Ward-Prowse, Henderson, and Rice. Two of the forwards can also play in midfield, so there isn't a lack of options. Many of these midfielders seem like average options. If Gundogan and Ward-Prowse can put up similar numbers to last season, that'll help the midfield a lot. However, when the next best players are McNeil and Fornals, I wouldn't say this is too far above an average midfield.</p>
<p>FW grade: B+</p>
<p>The forward line includes Salah, Rashford, Traore, and Wood. This is the position where the team shines and could most likely put Rashford and Traore in midfield. However, Rashford is going to be out about 1/3 of the season it looks like and Traore has new-faced competition in Bailey and Buendia. It's unknown whether Traore will start, but I'd say he's got a good chance judging by the end of last season. He'll at least be given a chance to prove himself as Bailey is unlikely to start at the beginning of the season as he adapts. Wood had a terrific season for Burnley last season and I wouldn't think he would do much worse this season. Then we have Salah, who will undoubtedly have a good year. One of the top 5 forwards in the league without a doubt. Perhaps this forward line would be better if it had a little more depth.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 4th</p>
<h3>Wan Young McTominaytor</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team is fairly balanced but has weak options in midfield. The forward and defense options don't make up for it and the goalkeepers are uninspiring. I'd expect the team to finish on the bottom half of the table.</p>
<p>GK grade: B+</p>
<p>One of the few teams with two goalkeepers. Leno and Lloris ironically both playing in North London and both had bad seasons. Both of them should recover in form, but it's less likely to be Lloris. On average between the two goalkeepers, I'd say you've got one decent goalkeeper.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B</p>
<p>The defenders include Maguire, Semedo, Pereira, Fabinho, Konate, Walker, and Soyuncu. There is a lot of depth in defense, but it lacks a real star defender. If Pereira can keep his starting role, I'd expect a very good season from him. Semedo also has the potential to have a better season. Maguire will definitely have a better season and should be his best scoring defender. There's not a lot of upside on the other defenders, with Fabinho also playing as a defender. This defense can rotate and do well, but it won't be one of the best in the league.</p>
<p>MID grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield includes Podence, Havertz, Kante, Raphinha, and Redmond. A big question mark on this midfield is the emergence of Havertz. This could be a fairly strong midfield if Havertz plays most games and has a better season than the last. But the only guaranteed star midfielder in my eyes is Raphinha. Podence had some good moments for Wolves last season but lost his place after getting injured early on. He's still suffering from injuries and the new signing of Trincao might make him the fourth choice winger. Kante is likely to play, but he's fairly average. The same goes for Redmond, who will likely play on the forward line for a struggling Southampton.</p>
<p>FW grade: B-</p>
<p>The forwards are Antonio, Watkins, and Richarlison. This also can include Podence as a secondary option. A big caveat to this team is the potential to sign Lukaku before the season starts, as the last pick in the draft. But purely based on the current strength of the forward line, it lacks depth and could have injury problems. There are already injuries to Podence, Watkins, and Richarlison will likely start the season late thanks to the Olympics. Antonio is also known for his injury issues. Overall the forwards are very solid, but lack depth and don't have the true superstar.</p>
