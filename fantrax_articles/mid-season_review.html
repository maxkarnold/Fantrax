<h1>Mid-Season Review: Draft Grades</h1>
<p>Looking back at my grades of the draft some of them were really bad. I thought it would be fun to look again at the drafts and see who drafted the best based on how players have done so far. Teams will get higher grades even if the players they drafted are no longer on their team. Remember, this is a review of the draft and not necessarily on how the team is doing now.</p>
<p>Once again we will be going in alphabetical order of the teams. As well as comparing the previous grade.</p>
<h3>30 Yard Screamers</h3>
<!-- <p>To briefly overview 30 Yard Screamers' team, it is filled with a star-studded defense, with risky picks throughout the rest of the squad.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: F ~ Previous grade: B</p>
<p>Leciester has been bad this year, but who would have thought that Kasper Schmeichel would have been one of the worst goalkeepers in fantasy this year, 17th best among goalkeepers.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A- ~ Previous grade: A+</p>
<p>His defense consists of Alexander-Arnold, Shaw, Veltman, Reguilon, Keane, and Aarons. An A+ grade was always going to be tough to match and was definitely too high on my part. Alexander-Arnold, Reguilon and Keane were big hits in the draft. All three are in the top 10 defenders and Alexander-Arnold is 2nd amongst all players. Veltman wasn't an awful draft pick, but is still without a team while Aarons and Shaw have been poor. This grade is stil high, just not as high as predicted.</p>
<p>MID grade: C ~ Previous grade: C</p>
<p>In midfield he drafted El Ghazi, Pogba, Saka, Townsend, Bissouma, and Ziyech. I gave this midfield a pretty harsh grade at the beginning of the season. It turns out that was pretty fair as only Townsend and El Ghazi remain on the team and Pogba was immediately traded for Havertz. We won't be grading for the trade. Anyways, El Ghazi hasn't been good so far this year, but Townsend has been a pleasant surprise ranking 7th for all midfielders. Bissouma and Ziyech turned out to be ok midfielders, while Saka has done decent, ranking 18th among midfielders.</p>
<p>FW grade: C- ~ Previous grade: B-</p>
<p>Moving on to his forward line, he drafted Cavani, Sancho, Sterling, and Martial. Cavani and Martial have turned out to be busts, which hasn't really hampered 30 yard screamers but makes them bad draft picks. Sancho is slowly acclimating to the Premier League and should improve as the season goes on, but is currently 49th among midfielders with 4.5 ppg. Sterling meanwhile has done pretty well, ranking 13th among forwards with 8.1 ppg. It's hard to say how good this part of the draft was, but Sterling and Sancho can definitely have much better second halves of the season.</p>
<!-- <p>Draft Rank: 8th</p> -->
<h3>Afternoon De Ligt</h3>
<!-- <p>On first look, Afternoon De Ligt looks like a team that is a little heavy on forwards but otherwise has a fairly balanced team.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: A ~ Previous grade: A</p>
<p>In goal, he has Alisson. As I predicted Alisson is one of the best goalkeepers in fantasy, ranking 4th among goalkeepers and 2nd among those that were drafted.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B+ ~ Previous grade: B</p>
<p>In defense, he drafted Rudiger, Tarkowski, White, and Castagne. In terms of defenders, this was actually a pretty good. Rudiger is a top ten defender in fantasy while Tarkowski is top 20. Castagne has been injury plagued all season but could expect a resurgent second half of the season, while White also is in the top 30 defenders despite being dropped. The only thing that could hold this back would be just the low number of defenders.</p>
<p>MID grade: C+ ~ Previous grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield drafted was Alli, Bruno Fernandes, Dallas, March, Rodri, Foden, and Willock. Despite the large number of midfielders drafted, they were mostly disappointing. Bruno was one of the top draft picks, but has had a tough start to the season. But, I'd expect him to recover as he's only 5th amongst midfielders. Dallas has quietly had a good year ranking 16th amongst midfielders. Foden is a little unlucky to be only 34th amongst midfielders as he's got 9.7 ppg. Rodri is also 31st amongst midfielders, while March ranks just 63rd and Alli was a bust, outside the top 100 midfielders.</p>
<p>FW grade: B- ~ Previous grade: C+</p>
<p>The forwards drafted were Firmino, Pepe, Vardy, Jesus, and Zaha. Both Vardy and Jesus are in the top 10 amongst forwards. Zaha has done decently ranking just outside the top 20 forwards, while Firmino has struggled with injuries and puts him just inside the top 40 forwards. Pepe is outside the top 40 and I'd say didn't work out as a good fantasy asset, as he's struggled for game time.</p>
<!-- <p>Draft Rank: 5th</p> -->
<h3>Can You Digne It</h3>
<!-- <p>At first glance, this looks like a very good team. However, it looks like a team that looks too much on past form and is likely to disappoint.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: C- ~ Previous grade: B+</p>
<p>In goal, Meslier has been worse than I predicted as Leeds United have not been on good form. He is 11th amongst goalkeepers.</p>
<p>DEF grade: D ~ Previous grade: C</p>
<p>The defense drafted was Ayling, Cresswell, Digne, Mings, Phillips, and Zouma. The defense has been pretty bad for the most part here. Digne, Mings, and Cresswell are outside the top 30 defenders, which isn't awful but not great either. Ayling and Phillips are outside the top 100 defenders, while Zouma's late move to West Ham has not allowed him to get going fantasy-wise yet. Things aren't super promising as he's only managed 5 ppg compared to last year's 9.3 ppg.</p>
<p>MID grade: A ~ Previous grade: A</p>
<p>The midfield he drafted was Groß, Harrison, Mount, Tielemans, Bernardo Silva, McGinn. This midfield has been super impressive so far, with Mount, Tielemans, Bernardo Silva, and McGinn in the top 11 midfielders of the league. I can see these midfielders to get even better, as Mount has had a slightly slow start to the season while Tielemans has shined for a struggling Leicester team. Harrison and Groß haven't been as good as they've struggled to nail down starting roles for their teams.</p>
<p>FW grade: C ~ Previous grade: B+</p>
<p>The forward line includes Aubameyang, Mahrez, Mane, and Greenwood. This is a very interesting forward line to discuss, starting with Aubamayeng. He started off the year fairly poor, had a couple of ok games and is now looking to be out of the Arsenal team for the rest of the season. Both Mahrez and Greenwood have been rotated within their squads, but have managed to do really well with Mahrez in the top 20 and Greenwood ranking 22nd among all forwards in the league. Mane has done very well this season, ranking 5th among forwards.</p>
<!-- <p>Draft Rank: 7th</p> -->
<h3>Gylfi Pleasures</h3>
<!-- <p>At first glance, Gylfi Pleasures is a team that doesn't look like it will finish bottom of the table but is also unlikely to reach the top. The team has a lot of safe picks, but might not be able to win every game.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: A ~ Previous grade: B</p>
<p>Mendy has continued to be a top class goalkeeper and I think I was harsh with his preseason grade. He ranks 3rd among all goalkeepers and 1st amongst those drafted.</p>
<p>DEF grade: A ~ Previous grade: A-</p>
<p>This defense drafted was James, Robertson, Dias, Cash, and Fofana. A very solid defense thanks to both James and Dias being in the top 10 defenders. Robertson has been good but has struggled with injuries and puts him just outside the top 20 defenders. Cash has actually done really well sitting within the top 20 defenders, while Fofana has yet to play this season.</p>
<p>MID grade: A ~ Previous grade: B+</p>
<p>The midfield drafted was Bowen, Maddison, Saint-Maximin, Smith Rowe, Lucas, and Phillips. This midfield is very good with Bowen, Saint-Maximin, and surprisingly Smith Rowe all in the top ten midfielders in the league. Plus he has other good options in Maddison and Lucas, who both are in the top 31 midfielders. I'd think Phillips would be a good draft pick, but he's suffered through injuries all season and hasn't had any consistency to remain healthy. I think this midfield is even better than I predicted.</p>
<p>FW grade: D+ ~ Previous grade: A-</p>
<p>The forwards drafted include Bailey, Calvert-Lewin, Kane, Torres, and Benteke. The forwards drafted here have a lot more talent than they've been showing this year, but combining a lack of form, injury issues, and squad rotation has managed to make Benteke his top scoring forward, ranking 20th among forwards. Calvert-Lewin and Bailey have looked good this year, but have both struggled with injuries at the wrong times. They rank outside the top 40 forwards as does Torres. Kane is the second highest forward drafted on this team but has only managed 6.2 ppg so far. He's 30th among forwards but I'd expect his points to rise.</p>
<!-- <p>Draft Rank: 2nd</p> -->
<h3>Maximum Arteta</h3>
<!-- <p>At first glance, this team is fairly balanced in each position but a lack of depth might hurt the team long-term.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: C ~ Previous grade: A</p>
<p>Nick Pope and Burnley have struggled out of the gates again this season. Pope is doing pretty awful too as he's ranked 11th amongst goalkeepers, just one spot above the previously mentioned Meslier.</p>
<p>DEF grade: D- ~ Previous grade: A</p>
<p>The defense drafted includes Coufal, Tierney, Wan-Bissaka, Firpo, Boly, and Lamptey. The defense drafted was a total bust and I admit that I overestimated it by a mile. Coufal, Tierney, and Wan-Bissaka have all done poorly and have each had times where they were rotated out of their respective teams. All three are ranked outside the top 45 defenders. Firpo and Boly are outside the top 100 defenders and are complete busts, while Lamptey has only recently come back from injury and looks like the best defender drafted on this team.</p>
<p>MID grade: D- ~ Previous grade: B</p>
<p>The midfield includes Armstrong, Grealish, Rodriguez, Soucek, Eze, and Thiago. A lot of these players have also struggled with injuries. Thiago has not really gotten consistent game time with injury problems while Eze is still taking his time coming back to full fitness after a long-term injury. Rodriguez never played a game under Rafael Benitez and is now gone. Armstrong has also struggled with injuries all season. Only Thiago, Soucek, and Grealish are in the top 100 midfielders this season, with Thiago outside the top 50. Grealish and Soucek have both been pretty disappointing as well, ranking 22nd and 19th among midfielders respectively. This midfield draft class has to be the worst I've seen in years.</p>
<p>FW grade: C+ ~ Previous grade: B-</p>
<p>The forwards drafted include Jota, Jimenez, Traore, Sarr. The forwards drafted from Maximum Arteta were actually not that bad and definitely not as bad as the midfield and defense. Traore and Jimenez rank 17th and 19th amongst forwards, despite Traore recently being benched by Wolves. Jota is 3rd amongst forwards despite usually playing backup to Firmino when both are fit. Sarr also sits in 21st despite being inconsistent</p>
<!-- <p>Draft Rank: 3rd</p> -->
<h3>Pretty Please with the Cherries on Top</h3>
<!-- <p>At first glance, this team feels fairly underwhelming with no real standout position. The forward line has a lot of players, but many of them have questions over them and are more likely to take up space than help the team. It's vital for this team for Heung-Min Son to do well.</p> -->
<p>GK grade: A- ~ Previous grade: B+</p>
<p>The goalkeepers drafted were Ederson and Pickford. I'm not really counting Pickford here as Ederson has been the better goalkeeper this season. Ederson ranks 5th among all goalkeepers which is pretty good, since that's third among those that were drafted. I would still categorize Ederson in a tier below the top, as his ppg is closer to goalkeepers below him.</p>
<p>DEF grade: C- ~ Previous grade: A-</p>
<p>The defenders drafted were Chilwell, Mee, Targett, and Doherty. Chilwell was a good draft pick but thanks to injuries has not been able to be played for most of the season. He currently ranks 29th among all defenders. Targett has been an average defender so far this season ranking 30th and Mee has struggled the same as all Burnley players this season but managing a higher ppg than Targett thanks to injuries. Doherty hasn't really played at all this year making him a bust.</p>
<p>MID grade: D- ~ Previous grade: C+</p>
<p>The midfield drafted was Barnes, Cantwell, Pulisic, Trossard, and Neves.</p>
<p>FW grade: C+</p>
<p>The forwards for this team include Ings, Son, Wilson, Adams, Lacazette, and Pukki.</p>
<p>The amount of depth at the forward position is kind of frightening. Luckily, Son can play in midfield and will likely be played there. Wilson is probably the only star forward other than Son in this team. Wilson had a terrific campaign last season and it's hard to tell whether he'll repeat it. Wilson did well with the chances given to him but struggled with injuries. Wilson can do better if he stays fit all season, but I find that unlikely. The other forwards are likely to give one hit. Adams and Pukki are going to start the season as the main forwards for their team, however, they play for struggling sides. There is potential and at least will be able to start. Ings and Lacazette are potentially very smart draft picks, but also have the potential to bust. Ings has just been bought by Aston Villa, but there's no guarantee he'll replace the younger Watkins. Lacazette has been linked away to make room for another forward at Arsenal. If he was to stay he has competition from Aubamayeng, Martinelli, and the young Balogun. Lacazette was the top scorer from last season, so you'd think he has a good chance of starting. But it's still a question mark.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 9th</p>
<h3>Singapore Slingers</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team could be very good but has a lot of potential outcomes. If Brentford outperforms their expectations and Singapore Slingers can get their best players starting, this could be a top-half team.</p>
<p>GK grade: B-</p>
<p>Sanchez is a very average keeper in the league as expected from one of the last keepers picked in the draft. I don't expect him to do better or worse this season.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B+</p>
<p>The defense includes Cancelo, Pinnock, Thiago Silva, Aurier, Saiss, Zinchenko. This defense has a lot of question marks, with one superstar defender. Cancelo can be the best fantasy defender in the league, but because of rotation won't play every game. It was a smart pick to get Zinchenko to play when Cancelo isn't picked in the starting XI. Other than that, it's hard to predict that both Pinnock and Thiago Silva will be above-average defenders. Saiss didn't start the whole of last season and lost his place to Kilman, however, he gained his place back and is a very good fantasy defender. Aurier is a great fantasy asset but faces competition from the favored Doherty and youngster Tanganga. There is enough depth that enough of the defenders should work out.</p>
<p>MID grade: A-</p>
<p>This midfield includes Buendia, De Bruyne, Jorginho, Ndidi, and Lingard. While the defense lacks quality, the midfield lacks depth. De Bruyne, Buendia, and Ndidi are probably the best collection of midfielders in the league. However, the only other options are Jorginho and Lingard. Jorginho is a fairly safe pick to start in Tuchel's system, but he's a very boom or bust player. Lingard is unlikely to start for Manchester United barring serious injuries similar to Liverpool last season. His COVID-19 illness will likely bar him from a move to another team, although there is the off chance he is loaned to a team like West Ham at the last minute.</p>
<p>FW grade: A</p>
<p>The forward line includes Bamford, Iheanacho, Werner, Toney, and Neto. This is a scary forward line, that could become one of the best in the league. However, there are a few question marks surrounding these players. Bamford, Iheanacho, and Neto all had breakout seasons. There's a question as to whether they can improve or continue that form into this season. Neto and Bamford are likely to play most games they are fit for, while Iheanacho still has to compete for time with Vardy and new signing Patson Daka. Meanwhile, Brentford's main goalscoring threat, Ivan Toney, is an interesting draft pick. People might have questions as to whether he can replicate his form from the Championship to the Premier League. I believe he can and he will. Werner has had a strange season with Chelsea, putting up decent numbers for goals and assists but perhaps not what Chelsea fans were looking for. Now that Chelsea is signing Lukaku, the main question is who will start alongside him. If Werner starts most games, I'd expect a very good season from him. Either way, this forward is brimming with talent and a lot of goals between them. Even if Neto is out for a decent amount of 2021, the rest of the forwards can most likely carry the load.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 1st</p>
<h3>Team Akio</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team has a lot of balance with positions. It has a lot of good players, but I'm wondering if it has the right players to make it a playoff contender.</p>
<p>GK grade: A+</p>
<p>You can't get much better than Martinez in goal. Aston Villa is just getting better and goalkeepers like Martinez got a buff in our scoring system.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B</p>
<p>The defense includes Azpilicueta, Stones, van Dijk, Cooper, Dunk, and Romero. This is an interesting group of defenders as all of them can play center back. It's an interesting draft decision but might not be the worst. Center backs have been slightly buffed this season and he has some good ones. Stones and Van Dijk are likely to be two of the highest-scoring center-backs in the league. The same goes for Azpilicueta if he plays, but I believe that Chelsea will buy a center-back to replace Azpilicueta by the end of the window. Romero is Tottenham's marquee signing this season and it should be interesting to see how quickly he adapts to the Premier League from Serie A. I wouldn't bet on Romero producing starting number stats, so I'd say he's right for the bench. The same goes for Dunk and Cooper, who are both fairly old and unlikely to produce higher numbers than last season.</p>
<p>MID grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield includes Fornals, Gundogan, McNeil, Ward-Prowse, Henderson, and Rice. Two of the forwards can also play in midfield, so there isn't a lack of options. Many of these midfielders seem like average options. If Gundogan and Ward-Prowse can put up similar numbers to last season, that'll help the midfield a lot. However, when the next best players are McNeil and Fornals, I wouldn't say this is too far above an average midfield.</p>
<p>FW grade: B+</p>
<p>The forward line includes Salah, Rashford, Traore, and Wood. This is the position where the team shines and could most likely put Rashford and Traore in midfield. However, Rashford is going to be out about 1/3 of the season it looks like and Traore has new-faced competition in Bailey and Buendia. It's unknown whether Traore will start, but I'd say he's got a good chance judging by the end of last season. He'll at least be given a chance to prove himself as Bailey is unlikely to start at the beginning of the season as he adapts. Wood had a terrific season for Burnley last season and I wouldn't think he would do much worse this season. Then we have Salah, who will undoubtedly have a good year. One of the top 5 forwards in the league without a doubt. Perhaps this forward line would be better if it had a little more depth.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 4th</p>
<h3>Wan Young McTominaytor</h3>
<p>At first glance, this team is fairly balanced but has weak options in midfield. The forward and defense options don't make up for it and the goalkeepers are uninspiring. I'd expect the team to finish on the bottom half of the table.</p>
<p>GK grade: B+</p>
<p>One of the few teams with two goalkeepers. Leno and Lloris ironically both playing in North London and both had bad seasons. Both of them should recover in form, but it's less likely to be Lloris. On average between the two goalkeepers, I'd say you've got one decent goalkeeper.</p>
<p>DEF grade: B</p>
<p>The defenders include Maguire, Semedo, Pereira, Fabinho, Konate, Walker, and Soyuncu. There is a lot of depth in defense, but it lacks a real star defender. If Pereira can keep his starting role, I'd expect a very good season from him. Semedo also has the potential to have a better season. Maguire will definitely have a better season and should be his best scoring defender. There's not a lot of upside on the other defenders, with Fabinho also playing as a defender. This defense can rotate and do well, but it won't be one of the best in the league.</p>
<p>MID grade: B-</p>
<p>The midfield includes Podence, Havertz, Kante, Raphinha, and Redmond. A big question mark on this midfield is the emergence of Havertz. This could be a fairly strong midfield if Havertz plays most games and has a better season than the last. But the only guaranteed star midfielder in my eyes is Raphinha. Podence had some good moments for Wolves last season but lost his place after getting injured early on. He's still suffering from injuries and the new signing of Trincao might make him the fourth choice winger. Kante is likely to play, but he's fairly average. The same goes for Redmond, who will likely play on the forward line for a struggling Southampton.</p>
<p>FW grade: B-</p>
<p>The forwards are Antonio, Watkins, and Richarlison. This also can include Podence as a secondary option. A big caveat to this team is the potential to sign Lukaku before the season starts, as the last pick in the draft. But purely based on the current strength of the forward line, it lacks depth and could have injury problems. There are already injuries to Podence, Watkins, and Richarlison will likely start the season late thanks to the Olympics. Antonio is also known for his injury issues. Overall the forwards are very solid, but lack depth and don't have the true superstar.</p>
<p>Draft Rank: 6th</p>
