<p>
	The premier league table is starting to take shape with familiar teams
	occupying the top seven positions. The FPL table isn't as straight forward
	with many more matches to play, this year looks to be the most competitive
	yet. A surprise victory from Maximum Arteta over Mourinho Out results in a
	two-way tie at the top of the table with Wan Young McTominaytor. Maximum
	Arteta holds third position equal on points with PuroAme, who has won five
	matches in a row. So Long GAY BOiii FC got his season back on track with an
	emphatic win over possibly the unluckiest team in the league so far,
	Singapore Slingers. With six losses in a row, Slingers dropped to 13th
	place, despite scoring the sixth-most points this season.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Singapore Slingers vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>95.25 - 147.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC scored the second-most points in a week this season
		with a convincing victory over Singapore Slingers. Singapore Slingers
		had an unlucky matchup this week and scored enough points to have beaten
		all but two teams this week. SLGB FC made a number of smart pickups
		recently and they combined for a great all-around performance for his
		team. His best pickups were players that went under the radar this past
		week and were picked up by SLGB FC. Brady (BUR) and Giroud (CHE)
		combined for 34.5 points this week to add to SLGB FC's performance.
		Perhaps, both Giroud and Brady can continue to get game time for their
		respective teams and add even more depth to SLGB FC's stacked roster.
		Other good pickups by SLGB FC include Stones (MCI) and Lloris (TOT) who
		both kept clean sheets to combine for 22.75 points. Vestergaard (SOU) of
		all people was the top scorer for SLGB FC this week with an important
		goal in Southampton's win against Brighton. He scored 25.75 points with
		a crazy stat line that included 10 aerials. Singapore Slingers had a
		very good week despite the loss and two of his players not playing. Son
		(TOT) had his best week since the trade for him with Mourinho Out with
		23 points (the most on the team). Salah also scored 21.5 points and has
		quietly been one of the best players this season with the sixth-most
		fantasy points. Eze (CRY) has now started four straight games for
		Crystal Palace and played 90 minutes in all of them, his continued use
		will be important for Slingers. Lamptey's (BHA) return this week from a
		three-match suspension was big for Slingers this week. Lamptey has been
		his best defender this season by far and scored 7 points despite
		Brighton's 2-1 defeat to Southampton.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs Mourinho Out</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>80.25 - 69.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In what may have been the most anticipated matchup of the week, Maximum
		Arteta beat Mourinho Out in a fairly low scoring game. A big loss for
		Mourinho Out was accentuated by the benching of Walker (MCI) and
		Townsend (CRY) for their respective teams. Semedo (WOL) scored an own
		goal and conceded four goals as a defender against Liverpool which gave
		him -8.25 points. A typically standout defender was a big reason for the
		loss in a disappointing week for the table leader. His top scorers were
		Calvert-Lewin (EVE) and Kane (TOT) with 33.5 points combined this week.
		However, both McBurnie (SHU) and Gro&szlig; (BHA) scored 15+ points this
		week and would have been difference-makers in a close matchup with
		Maximum Arteta. Despite topping the table, Mourinho Out clearly lacks
		balance in the team and it leaves an opportunity for other teams to move
		ahead in the table. Maximum Arteta also had a disappointing week with
		defender Dann (CRY) benched and Pereira (WBA) getting a red card in the
		same game. Pereira is going to be out for three games with a suspension,
		but luckily for Maximum Arteta, the midfield is a position where he has
		a surplus of quality players. All of his other midfielders that started,
		scored in double digits this week as well as Brownhill (BUR) on his
		bench.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Wan Young McTominaytor vs SAMURAI BOMBER</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>98.25 - 75.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor continued his winning streak to seven games this
		week with a good victory over SAMURAI BOMBER. He had the second-most
		points in a fairly low scoring week, with only three double-digit
		performers. De Bruyne (MCI), Matip (LIV), and Aurier (TOT) combined for
		62.5 points this week. De Bruyne had the second-highest points this
		week, only behind Benteke (CRY), who was not on any team. A great
		performance covered up the lack of points from his other midfielders and
		forward. McTominaytor's team has been very fluid this season, with new
		players coming into the team every week. He'll need to continue to get
		good performances in order to keep his winning streak going. Meanwhile,
		for SAMURAI BOMBER, Mount was his best player with 24 points this week.
		It was a tough week for him as a whole as both Cavani (MUN) and Masuaku
		(WHU) were injured in the same game. Cavani recently made his way into
		Manchester United's first team with good performances off the bench,
		this is not a good sign for Cavani as he has tough competition if
		Martial (MUN) can get back into form. Masuaku had knee surgery and it's
		unknown for how long he'll be out. Walcott (SOU) also had a bad game
		this week, scoring only -0.5 points and being subbed off. Now that Ings
		(SOU) is back from injury, I expect Walcott to become more of a rotation
		player for Southampton.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>AC Al&auml;cr&acirc;n vs Scary FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>84.5 - 71</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		AC Al&auml;cr&acirc;n defeated Scary FC in a fairly close matchup in
		which a balanced performance from his squad helped achieve victory. AC
		Al&auml;cr&acirc;n had five players with double-digit points this week.
		One of those players was Ward-Prowse (SOU), with 16.5 points.
		Ward-Prowse is having the best season of his career so far and now in
		the top ten players with the most points so far. Alexander-Arnold (LIV)
		is having a very disappointing season so far, thanks to a struggling
		Liverpool defense. Alexander-Arnold was fourth overall in points last
		season and was the best defender by far. Alexander-Arnold is coming back
		from an injury and will hope to pick up his form going into a busy
		December. For Scary FC, he had a surprise top performer this week in
		Rodri (MCI), with 14.5 points. It was Rodri's best game of the season so
		far. Scary FC has had a lot of tough injuries this season but had an
		encouraging sign when van de Beek (MUN) started for Manchester United.
		However, Manchester United was poor in the first half against West Ham
		and van de Beek was subbed off for Fernandes (MUN). Fernandes was most
		likely rested for the Champions League game that was played against RB
		Leipzig on Tuesday. Fernandes had another great performance, despite
		only playing 45 minutes. Van de Beek will most likely struggle to make
		it into Manchester United's starting eleven barring injuries in key
		positions. Scary FC didn't play Wan-Bissaka (MUN) this week, in what has
		been a poor start so far for the defender, similar to Alexander-Arnold.
		Doherty (TOT) has now been benched in three straight games and it'll be
		interesting to see if he starts Spurs' next game. Perhaps Mourinho
		prefers to play with Aurier (TOT) against tougher opponents, in which
		case Doherty should continue to be rotated with Aurier.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>PuroAme vs Red Dragons</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>66.5 - 48</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		One of the most in-form teams, PuroAme, defeated one of the most out of
		form, Red Dragons, in a close match. PuroAme has now won five straight,
		whereas Red Dragons have lost five straight. In a fairly low scoring
		game, Red Dragons had an opportunity to win the matchup had he played
		Zaha (CRY), who would have been his top scorer. Zaha scored 24 points
		this week when Crystal Palace ran all over West Brom. Digne (EVE)
		continues to be out with an injury and was given a three-match
		suspension back when Red Dragons traded Vardy (LEI) for him. Vardy has
		continued to do his thing and Digne's absence has meant that Red Dragons
		has lacked options in defense. Koch (LEE) is undergoing knee surgery
		now, which makes things even more difficult for Red Dragons. Red Dragons
		need Ag&uuml;ero (MCI) to start playing games as he needs all the help
		he can get right now. Red Dragons play SLGB FC this week and are going
		to need a special performance to end this losing run.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs 2 Goals 1 Cup</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>79.25 - 36</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		North London Troopz was able to defeat 2 Goals 1 Cup in a convincing
		victory thanks to a balanced team performance. Five players scored in
		double digits for him this week, including new pickup Ayoze P&eacute;rez
		(LEI). Perez was his top scorer with 17 points and his first goal of the
		season. Perez has struggled to make an impact on the wing for Leicester
		and has not really lived up to expectations after a great season at
		Newcastle. Maybe now P&eacute;rez can break into Rodgers' team. He'll
		have to compete with Barnes (LEI) and &Uuml;nder (LEI) for wing
		positions as well as Rodgers' formation. Rodgers has been playing wing
		backs with no wingers as of late, and we'll see if he continues the
		season with it. 2 Goals 1 Cup had a very disappointing defense and
		goalkeeper performance this week, they combined for -3.5 points this
		week. Ndombele (TOT) was hurt, while Maupay (BHA) came off the bench
		after an injury for Brighton this week. The one bright spot for 2 Goals
		1 Cup was the combination of Pulisic (CHE) and Werner (CHE) for a goal
		in the second half. Pulisic came on for Ziyech (CHE) after the winger
		got injured and should mean that Pulisic might see some way back into
		the starting eleven despite an ever-growing list of injuries. When
		Pulisic is fit, he's been very good for Chelsea, and he definitely has
		the ability to lock down a starting spot.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>#TindallBall vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>49.5 - 13.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The lowest scoring matchup during the week, saw #Tindallball achieve a
		comfortable victory over lackluster 30 Yard Screamers. A huge boost for
		#Tindallball this week as Ings (SOU) capped his return from injury with
		a goal off the bench. Ings didn't have any problems coming on as a
		substitution, so I'd expect him to make it straight back into the
		starting eleven for Southampton's clash against Sheffield United. A very
		poor week from the other forwards and midfielders was patched up by a
		solid defensive performance from his team. Maguire (MUN), Cooper (LEE),
		and Alderweireld (TOT) combined for 23.25 points this week and have been
		consistent performers, in general, this season. Worries for Cooper as
		Leeds United, lost two center backs to injury this week and Cooper will
		have a partner in defense for their match against West Ham United.
		Cooper has been surprisingly solid so far, despite Leeds United
		conceding so many goals so far this season. A big miss as of late has
		been the omission of Barnes (LEI) from Leicester's starting lineup.
		Rodgers has dealt with a lot of injuries this season and has tinkered
		with the formation which has left no room for Barnes. As full backs,
		Castagne (LEI) and Pereira (LEI) come back from injury, I'd expect
		Barnes' game time to increase. 30 Yard Screamers best pickup this week
		was Jones (LIV), with 6 points. A very disappointing performance was
		probably made worse by the fact that Robertson was on his bench with 12
		points (scoring almost as much as his whole team combined). 30 Yard
		Screamers has struggled with injuries this season as well as players
		losing favor with their manager. 30 Yard Screamers needs performances
		from his players badly, and a quick return to form from Antonio (WHU)
		after a few weeks of injury. Antonio has been his best player so far
		this season and his absence has not been kind to his team.
