<!-- intro paragraph -->
<p>
	In the Premier League this week, the goals have finally started to slow
	down. Six out of the ten games were draws this week. In the FPL, goalkeepers
	had a much better week with only one starting goalkeeper scoring negative
	points.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>So Long Gay BOiii FC vs PuroAme</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>74 - 122.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The big surprise of the weekend was PuroAme’s victory against former
		league leader So Long Gay BOiii FC. PuroAme had a substantial victory
		scoring almost 50 points more than SLGB FC. His defense did very well
		this week, combining for about 45 points. Two newcomers into his
		starting lineup Fofana (LEI) and Lookman (FUL) both combined for 35
		points this week. PuroAme will hope that they can keep starting for
		their respective teams and continue to put up big numbers. SLGB FC
		didn’t have an awful game this week, but all his star players had
		average performances this week. His highest scoring players were hardly
		surprising, including Rodriguez (EVE), Sterling (MCI) and Saint-Maximin
		(NEW). But none of his players scored over 15 points, while he had a
		disappointing output from his defenders combining for just 5 points
		total. SLGB FC can count himself very unlucky this week, although it is
		worrying that his first round draft pick Traore (WOL) has only played 95
		minutes in the past three gameweeks. PuroAme on the other hand has
		picked up his second straight win and will look to continue his good
		form against Scary FC next week.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs #TindallBall</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>59.5 - 63.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In the closest game of the week, #TindallBall narrowly defeated North
		London Troopz by four points in order to get his first win of the
		season. #TindallBall had a lot of injury concerns going into the game
		and can probably thank the 21.75 point performance from Maguire (MUN)
		for the win. Maguire has had a horrible start to the season scoring
		-8.25 points total after 3 games going into this week. North London
		Troopz still had a chance of winning the game thanks to the clean sheet
		from Martinez and Mings (AVL). However, decent performances from Podence
		and Moutinho (WOL) in the last game of the week sealed it. Moutinho
		actually had a yellow card, but was subbed out by manager Nuno Espírito
		Santo in the second half to seal the victory for #TindallBall. A notable
		red card from Dunk (BHA) really hurt NLTroopz chances, while a total of
		-0.75 points on his bench meant he didn’t have many options to take out
		players.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Scary FC vs Wan Young McTominaytor</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>73.75 vs 78</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor defeated Scary FC in a close game this week, even
		with first overall pick De Bruyne (MCI) injured this week. Since his
		slow start to the season, Havertz (CHE) has picked up his form and
		scored his first ever premier league goal. McTominaytor had fairly
		average performances all around but can be happy that his four defenders
		combined for about 38 points this week. Scary FC had perhaps the best
		performing defenders in the league this week and perhaps has the best
		defenders of any team for the foreseeable future. His three defenders
		combined for about 44 points, while two defenders on his bench combined
		for about 25 points. Thiago (LIV) had his first full game as a Liverpool
		player and didn’t disappoint scoring 11 points with stats all around.
		Scary FC will hope that Partey (ARS) and van de Beek (MUN) are
		integrated more into their respective teams, so that he has more options
		in his midfield.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs 2 Goals 1 Cup</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>53.5 - 39.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Red Dragons defeated 2 Goals 1 Cup in the lowest scoring matchup of the
		week. It was a great move by the Red Dragons manager to pick up Mata
		(MUN) and start him for this week. Red Dragons had a lot of good
		performances on his bench as well as there was a surprising start from
		first round pick Mane (LIV) who scored 18.5 points. McNeil (BUR) scored
		12.5 points on his bench and Koch scored 7.5. Red Dragons’ defense
		scored -3.75 points this week thanks to a pre-game injury to Holding
		(ARS), 3 minutes played by James (CHE) and a poor game from Ogbonna
		(WHU). Reece James has now been benched in two straight games for
		Chelsea, most likely to fit club leader Azpilicueta into the starting
		eleven. Perhaps the three goals conceded by Chelsea will make Lampard
		rethink his lineup and give James another chance. For 2 Goals 1 Cup an
		own goal from Sanchez (TOT) and three players who he started, but didnt’
		play for their respective teams didn’t help his team’s already poor
		performance. Werner’s (CHE) 30.5 point performance accounted for most of
		his points and the return of Pulisic (CHE) might mean good things for 2
		Goals 1 Cup in the future. With four Chelsea players in his team 2 Goals
		1 Cup will need Chelsea to win more games if he’s to get off the bottom
		of the table.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>30 Yard Screamers vs Maximum Arteta</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>51 - 139.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		One of the largest victories of the season saw Maximum Arteta defeat 30
		Yard Screamers by nearly 90 points. After scoring 100 points last week,
		30 Yard Screamers seriously underperformed this week. Not a single
		player scored in the double digits, while nobody on his entire bench
		scored any points. It was always going to be difficult to see Antonio
		(WHU), Jorginho (CHE) and Wilson (NEW) to all replicate their
		performances from last week. This week saw Pepe (ARS) start for Arsenal
		in what 30 Yard Screamers will hope will be more common from now on. He
		recently traded Wan-Bissaka (MUN) for Pepe, and seeing Wan-Bissaka’s
		performance this week may have him second guessing himself. On the other
		side, Maximum Arteta had terrific performances throughout his whole
		team. Fernandes (MUN) scored 35 points this week as Manchester United
		got a much needed win. A trade earlier in the season, which saw him
		trade Pepe for Nick Pope (BUR) paid off this week as Pope scored 20.25
		points. Kilman (WOL) started his second straight game for Wolves with
		injuries at left wing back, he’ll hope that Kilman continues to start
		and perform in the future.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out vs AC Aläcrân</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>120 - 48</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Another huge victory for Mourinho Out over AC Aläcrân, which saw him
		take the number one position in the league. Son and Kane (TOT) once
		again combined for over 50 points this week. Their combination play has
		been so good since Mourinho has taken charge, the team name seems more
		ironic than anything. The rest of his team was fairly average today with
		some good performers on the defensive end. Semedo (WOL), Long (BUR) and
		Robinson (SHU) combined for 32 points this week. Phillips (LEE) picked
		up an injury this week and will be out for an extended period of time.
		On the other side AC Aläcrân had a disastrous week that didn’t start
		well. Alexander-Arnold and Fabinho (LIV) combined for 2 points and
		Richarlison (EVE) got a red card at the end of the game. AC Aläcrân
		started two Wolves defenders that didn’t play and his only players in
		double digits were Patricio (WOL) and two Villa players Barkley and
		McGinn (AVL).

	<h2>
		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>70.25 vs 126.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A very good performance from Singapore Slingers saw him defeat SAMURAI
		BOMBER this week as he moved into fourth place this week. Singapore
		Slingers goalkeeper Darlow (NEW) scored an impressive 18.75 points even
		while conceding 4 goals. Darlow has been terrific for the injured
		Dubravka so far and Slingers will hope that Darlow can keep his place
		once the injured Dubravka comes back. Tarkowski (BUR) did terrific this
		week scoring 18 points and his defense combined for about 52 points this
		week. Decent performances from Salah (LIV) and Calvert-Lewin (EVE)
		helped his team score the second highest in the league this week.
		Meanwhile, SAMURAI BOMBER got 37 points from Rashford (MUN) which wasn’t
		enough. If it wasn’t for Rashford’s points, the game would not have been
		close at all. This combined with Lacazette (ARS) not starting and van
		Dijk (LIV) suffering a season-ending injury is going to make things look
		really glum for SAMURAI BOMBER’s season.
