	The premier league table is starting to form with some teams surprisingly
	having a rough start to the season. The same can be said for the FPL so far.
	Three of the top four teams from last year are in the bottom half of the
	table. Perhaps the most surprising being Singapore Slingers who has the 5th
	most points scored in the league so far, but stands at 10th in the
	standings. So Long GAY BOiii FC had a very promising start to the year but
	with his latest loss he dropped down to fifth in the table. No time for
	panicking but definitely not meeting the expectations at the beginning of
	the year. A few of the teams on the rise of late are Scary FC and PuroAme
	who are on nice little winning streaks with PuroAme's latest win putting him
	into fourth place.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>#TindallBall vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>64.5 - 62.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		#Tindallball scored a huge upset for his second win of the season
		against underperforming SLGB FC. SLGB FC has struggled lately with
		disappointing performances from Rodriguez (EVE), Saint-Maximin (NEW),
		and Soucek (WHU). Rodriguez is the 11th highest scorer in the league,
		but his form has dipped as of late along with Everton despite their
		victory over Fulham. Now that Rodriguez is hopefully fully fit and back
		from injury as well as the return of Richarlison, Everton will hope they
		can get another win against Leeds next week. Despite the loss for SLGB
		FC, he had great performances from Lloris (TOT) and Firmino (LIV). Both
		scored season highs this week and are generally not top performers.
		Looking at SLGB FC's bench this week, you can see why there's been
		struggles. Sterling (MCI) was a big move and despite two big
		performances after the trade with #TindallBall he has been very bad.
		Traore (WOL) has not gotten into the Wolves starting lineup lately, with
		rumors of contract negotiations being the reason. He has reason to be
		optimistic with Castagne (LEI) possibly coming back from injury next
		week and Traore getting back into the starting lineup. Another player
		who got a surprise start for Wolves this week was Moutinho (WOL) who's
		performance was massive for #Tindallball's victory. This was Moutinho's
		first 90 minutes of the season with Neves and Dendoncker typically
		favored ahead of him. He scored in double digits as well as Maguire
		(MUN), Cooper (LEE), and Alisson (LIV). This game was close and low
		scoring, but #Tindallball was able to win despite Fernandez (NEW)
		scoring an own goal and scoring -9.5 points.

		<strong><em>AC Aläcrân vs PuroAme</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>51.75 - 86</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		PuroAme continued his run of good form with a win over AC Aläcrân to
		move into fourth. PuroAme has had a great run of form lately and can
		definitely attribute that to players just starting to make their way
		into their respective first teams. Chilwell (CHE) has been the best
		defender in the league in terms of points so far and he started off the
		season with an injury. Ziyech (CHE), Reguilon (TOT), and Lookman (FUL)
		have been great new signings that have been introduced into their teams.
		And the surprise emergence of Fofana (LEI) into Leicester City's
		starting lineup thanks to injuries and Abraham (CHE) has also taken
		advantage of the injury to Pulisic pushing out new signing Werner to the
		left hand side. Perhaps the form of these Chelsea players will not last
		and who knows if Abraham will stay in the team when Pulisic is back from
		injury. PuroAme had a lot of decent performances this week with all his
		players scoring 4.5+ points this week except for Ederson (MCI) who
		scored -4. AC Aläcrân had a bad game this week and an unfortunate injury
		to Barkley (AVL) five minutes into the Aston Villa game. His only
		performers in double digits were Coufal (WHU) and Lindelof (MUN). Coufal
		has been excellent so far with just two negative games against Totenham
		and Liverpool. Benrahma (WHU) was a risky play by AC Aläcrân, and he
		didn't come off the bench in West Ham's victory over Sheffield United.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out vs 2 Goals 1 Cup</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>113.25 - 84.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Mourinho Out continued an eight game winning streak with a victory over
		bottom of the league, 2 Goals 1 Cup. 2 Goals 1 Cup had a surprisingly
		good performance this week with the 6th most points this week. This was
		despite only having 9 players in his starting lineup with Coady (WOL)
		left out of the squad for being in close contact with someone who had
		COVID and Azpilicueta who sees himself on the outside looking in to a
		Chelsea defense that has gotten better and better this season. 2 Goals 1
		Cup didn't have any crazy performances this week but got double digits
		from Werner (CHE), Ndombele (TOT), March (BHA), Kovacic (CHE), Kouyate
		(CRY), and Leno (ARS). Both teams had just made a trade this week with 2
		Goals 1 Cup playing Maupay (BHA) for the first time. Maupay only scored
		2 points this week and has not had a goal contribution since October
		3rd. Going the other way Redmond (SOU) was not in the squad this week
		having been dealing with injuries. Mourinho Out had very good
		performances this week specifically from Calvert-Lewin (EVE) who scored
		27.5 points in a 3-2 victory for Everton. Groß (BHA) has recently been
		getting regular time in the starting lineup and has done well
		fantasy-wise. Mourinho Out also had 36.5 points on the bench this week,
		the third most in the league. However, this included Fleck (SHU) who was
		on the injured reserve this week despite playing 90 minutes. Mourinho
		Out currently has 2 uninjured players in his IR and will have a tough
		time choosing to drop players on his team.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Wan Young McTominaytor vs Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>117 - 51.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor thoroughly dominated his cousin, Singapore
		Slingers, this week with the most points in the league. Wan Young
		McTominaytor also had the second most points on his bench this week with
		a standout performance all around. Wan Young McTominaytor had great
		performances, but his best came from Haller (WHU) and Jota (LIV) both
		combining for 45.5 points this week. Haller has come in for the injured
		Antonio (WHU) and scored his second goal of the season. Jota continued
		an amazing run and is now the only ever Liverpool player to score in
		their first four home games. Some of the notable contributors on the
		bench were Matip (LIV) with 14.25 points and Traore (AVL) with 13.5
		points. With Barkley's injury, Traore could get more gametime for Aston
		Villa. It was a real down week for Singapore Slingers, scoring the least
		amount of points in the league. Lamptey (BHA) and Darlow (NEW) have been
		some of Slingers' best players this season but combined for -0.75 points
		this week. Darlow only managed 2 saves in Newcastle's defeat to Chelsea
		this week and Lamptey was sent off after a second yellow card in
		Brighton's 2-1 victory over Aston Villa. This means Lamptey will be out
		for the next game as well, which will be a big miss for Slingers. His
		only double digit scorers this week were Tarkowski (BUR) and Son (TOT),
		but it was not enough to offset a lot of disappointing performances.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs SAMURAI BOMBER</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>67.75 - 91</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A close game until Monday saw SAMURAI BOMBER defeat North London Troopz.
		North London Troopz had the most points in the league on his bench this
		week including Fabianski (WHU) with 18 points. If he had swapped
		goalkeepers, North London Troopz would have had 20 more points and with
		a couple of other swaps may have seen him won this week. A fairly decent
		week from SAMURAI BOMBER was helped on Monday with three Southampton
		players combining for 34.75 points. Djenepo (SOU) had just been picked
		up this week and scored a solid 9 points. SAMURAI BOMBER's best
		performer was his goalkeeper with 14.25 points in a balanced
		performances from his whole team. For North London Troopz, some great
		performances were overshadowed by very poor ones from his top two draft
		picks. Aubamayeng (ARS) and Mahrez (MCI) combined for 9.5 points this
		week in what is becoming an all too common occurence this season. He
		also had negative points from his goalkeeper and two defenders which
		didn't help. However, the first premier league start of the season for
		Telles (MUN) had him score 12.75 points this week. Telles will surely
		take the place of Luke Shaw in the coming games, but with Solskjaer will
		we ever know? Zouma (CHE) did well as he usually does with another clean
		sheet. Zouma is currently the second best defender in the league so far
		and continues to be the bright spot for North London Troopz. Doucoure
		(EVE) scored a season high 23.5 points this week and gave North London
		Troopz a chance in the matchup. Other than Fabianski, North London
		Troopz would have probably benefitted from starting Tierney (ARS) or
		Wijnaldum (LIV) this week.

		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs Red Dragons</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>110.25 - 89.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Maximum Arteta sealed the victory on Monday in the highest scoring
		matchup of the week against Red Dragons. Maximum Arteta had to wait for
		most of his players to play later in the week. A big clean sheet from
		Burnley saw Maximum Arteta's players from Burnely combine for 41 points.
		Other than great performances by Pope (BUR) and Mee (BUR), Fernandes
		(MUN) was his best performer this week with 24.5 points with another
		excellent game this week. Fernandes has the second most points in the
		league after that performance and continues to be a bright spot in an
		average Manchester United team. Maddison played his first full 90
		minutes this season and didn't disappoint despite Leicester's 3-0 loss
		ot Liverpool. Despite the win by Maximum Arteta, he had a disappointing
		performance from Grealish (AVL) with 3.5 points. Red Dragons had an
		excellent week for their defenders with Digne (EVE) being the standout
		performer. Digne was able to show why Red Dragons traded Vardy for him
		with two assists in a 26.25 point performance. Disappointingly Zaha
		(CRY) and Hendrick (NEW) didn't play this week due to COVID isolation
		for Zaha and Hendrick not starting. This was the first time Hendrick was
		benched all season, so it remains to be seen if he gets gametime in the
		future. Aguero (MCI) was on the bench for Manchester City and Red
		Dragons as he watched them both lose. Aguero will hopefully be fully fit
		for Manchester City's next game and give Red Dragons more options to
		work with.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>30 Yard Screamers vs Scary FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>74 - 83.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Scary FC won his fourth in a row against a struggling 30 Yard Screamers.
		Scary FC was able to get the win despite a Evans (LEI) own goal which
		gave him -8 points. The matchup was very close but Neto (WOL) and Wood
		(BUR) combined for 30 points to win it for Scary FC. Neto came off the
		bench and scored a goal for Wolves and Wood scored the winning goal for
		Burnley in their first victory of the season. Scary FC had good
		performances from his defense again, other than Evans, with Balbuena
		(WHU), Wan-Bissaka (MUN), and Schmeichel (LEI) all scoring in double
		digits. Rodri (MCI) scored a season high 14 points on Scary FC's bench,
		but he didn't need it this week. 30 Yard Screamers on the other hand,
		had 2 points on his bench total with not many options on his bench.
		Wilson (NEW) and Antonio (WHU) are still injured and are big misses for
		his team. Costa (LEE) didn't start for Leeds this week and didn't come
		off the bench. 30 Yard Screamers also played Bernard who didn't start
		for Everton. However, Martial (MUN) scored a season high this week
		despite not contributing to a goal. This is a good sign for 30 Yard
		Screamers. Another player who's been generally underperforming has been
		Robertson (LIV), but he scored a season high of 25.5 points. Johnstone
		(WBA) had a very good game against his former club, Manchester United,
		this week. He was unlucky not to get a clean sheet after Manchester
		United won a penalty for a handball and he saved the following penalty.
		However, Johnstone was off his line and was forced to attempt to save a
		second penalty which he didn't. Bellerin (ARS) has done very well so far
		this season, despite some worrying performances from Arsenal. He's
		averaging 9.1 points per game, which is the most since the 2015-2016
		season where he really broke out as a first team regular, playing 36
		games.
