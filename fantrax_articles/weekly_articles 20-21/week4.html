<p>
	The goals did not stop pouring in this week, even with no controversy over
	penalty calls. Many of the matchups in the FPL were one-sided with So Long
	GAY BOiii FC scoring the most points in a matchup this season. The one close
	matchup saw AC Aläcrân come back to win against SAMURAI BOMBER after a crazy
	Sunday.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Wan Young McTominaytor vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>95.25 - 150.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC claimed victory convincingly against Wan Young
		McTominaytor in the highest-scoring match of the week. Wan Young
		McTominaytor will count himself unlucky to play S.L.G.B. this week as he
		would have won had he played against one of 9 teams that scored less
		than him this week. He had some great performers this week along with
		some surprise starters that repaid his faith in them. Both Aurier (TOT)
		and Saka (ARS) started for their respective teams this week having both
		sat out of the last week. They scored over 36 points combined which
		he’ll hope can put them into starting contention for their teams. A big
		surprise was his bench player Watkins (AVL) scoring 43.5 points against
		Liverpool. Was this a fluke performance or a sign of things to come?
		Meanwhile, So Long GAY BOiii FC tore it up this week with excellent
		performers from most of his team. He acquired both Firmino (LIV) and
		Sterling (MCI) this week after two big trades with #TindallBall and 2
		Goals 1 Cup. They both combined for 38 points this week which he’ll hope
		is a sign of things to come. His first-round pick Adama Traore (WOL)
		didn’t even start this week. So Long GAY BOiii FC made some serious
		moves to consolidate his place as the top team in the league right now
		and barring injury to key players will look to keep it going for weeks
		to come.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>AC Aläcrân vs SAMURAI BOMBER</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>75.75 - 56.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		AC Aläcrân made a huge comeback to defeat SAMURAI BOMBER after two shock
		results which saw Tottenham beat Manchester United 6 -1 and Aston Villa
		defeat Liverpool 7 - 2. AC Aläcrân started Alexander-Arnold (LIV) who
		ended with -6.25 points but won’t be too bothered after his recent
		pickup Barkley (AVL) and Villa teammate McGinn (AVL) combined for 41.5
		points. Barkley was recently loaned to Aston Villa from Chelsea and AC
		Aläcrân made a shrewd decision to pick him up before the transfer was
		even announced. It was worrying to see Richarlison (EVE) re-injured in
		Everton’s game, but AC Aläcrân will be happy to be level on points with
		the top of the table. SAMURAI BOMBER on the other hand will be anything
		but pleased after his team blew such a large lead. He made great
		decisions to pick up Fornals (WHU) and Sigurdsson (EVE) scoring a
		combined 43.5 points. He was ultimately hurt by the -3.75 from van Dijk
		(LIV) and -7.75 from de Gea (MUN). One of his better players, Mount
		(CHE), didn’t start for the first time this season and gave him 0 points
		in Chelsea’s win over Crystal Palace. SAMURAI BOMBER was quite
		unfortunate in this game and will look to bounce back after the
		international break.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs Scary FC </em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>111 - 39.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Maximum Arteta defeated Scary FC in an even matchup until the late games
		on Sunday. A very close game that was ultimately put out of reach,
		without a doubt, thanks to Jack Grealish (AVL). In perhaps the
		highest-scoring game of any player so far this season, Grealish got 2
		goals and 3 assists on his way to scoring 51 points against the reigning
		champions Liverpool. Who saw that one coming? Other than the performance
		by Grealish, Maximum Arteta had a fairly average all-around performance
		and should look to make changes going into the international break.
		Scary FC had a very unlucky game this week, to say the least. One of his
		top defenders, Doherty (TOT), didn’t start this week (probably due to
		Tottenham’s fixture congestion). Wan-Bissaka (MUN) had another poor
		performance of -8 points this week after Scary FC traded Pepe (ARS) for
		him. No big performances from his team this week means he will hope
		Cancelo (MCI) and Allan (EVE) are fit after the international break.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>#TindallBall vs Mourinho Out</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>26.25 vs 101</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Mourinho Out took an easy victory over #TindallBall this week after
		another great performance from the Tottenham duo. A massive 33.5 points
		from Kane (TOT) were key to his victory, not mentioning decent
		performances from Bowen (WHU), Semedo (WOL), and new goalkeeper Mendy
		(CHE). Mourinho Out had Son (TOT) on his bench scoring 34 points even
		though he suffered a hamstring injury just last week. He didn’t need
		Son’s points to win the game but will be wondering how his team can do
		if the Tottenham duo goes out of form. #TindallBall played only one
		player who didn’t start this week, which was the goalkeeper Alisson
		(LIV). He’ll be happy that he didn’t since Liverpool conceded 7 goals
		without him. #TindallBall made a huge trade in midweek to trade away his
		second overall pick, Sterling (MCI), and Egan (SHU) for Willian (ARS)
		and Cooper (LEE). Perhaps his team needed the balance in scoring but was
		most likely disappointed to see Sterling score over 20 points this week,
		while the two players he received in the trade combined for 10. Willian
		was especially disappointing, scoring less than 4 points for the third
		game in a row. Mourinho Out is looking like the second-best team in the
		league so far, whereas #TindallBall will have to wait till after the
		international break for his first win of the season.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>2 Goals 1 Cup vs PuroAme</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>34.25 - 86</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		PuroAme defeated 2 Goals 1 Cup with a 36.25 point performance from
		Chilwell (CHE) in his first game. PuroAme had injuries to Ziyech (CHE),
		Ndidi (LEI), and Pereira (LEI), but was still able to score 86 points
		thanks to Chilwell and some other decent performances. He’ll keep an eye
		on striker Abraham (CHE), as his game time this season might suffer once
		key players come back from injury. 2 Goals 1 Cup was fairly unlucky this
		week with several of his players not starting this week, most likely due
		to fixture congestion. Kovacic (CHE), Lucas (TOT), and Xhaka (ARS) all
		did not start this week. Bad performances from Werner (CHE), Greenwood
		(MUN), and Gomez (LIV) really hurt him this week. He was involved in one
		of the blockbuster trades with So Long GAY BOiii FC this week. He traded
		Firmino (LIV) and van Aanholt (CRY) for Cresswell (WHU) and March (BRI).
		Both the players he traded for did really well this week, however,
		Cresswell scored 31.5 points on his bench. He’s unlikely to score that
		many points again, but it’s surprising to see a player he traded for not
		put into his starting lineup. After the international break, he’ll have
		the returns of Pulsic and Redmond to look forward to. 2 Goals 1 Cup’s
		team isn’t as bad as it’s shown, so I expect 2 Goals 1 Cup to bounce
		next game.

		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>72 - 100</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		30 Yard Screamers defeated reigning champions North London Troopz with
		an uneven performance. 30 Yard Screamers had a strange performance to
		score exactly 100 points with many standout performers, but also many
		negative point performances. He got very good games from Wilson (NEW),
		Jorginho (CHE), Antonio (WHU), and Bellerín (ARS), combining for 108.5
		points. This was partially offset by -22 points combined from Guaita
		(CRY), Robertson (LIV), Shaw (MUN), and Martial (MUN). Star players were
		mostly outshone by the average players who came up big this week. On the
		other hand, North London Troopz’s team was balanced all around. His top
		scorer was Zouma (CHE) with 22 points but was on his bench. He’ll be
		relieved that it wouldn’t have won him the game, but disappointed by
		average performance all around. His best performers came from Everton
		(Mina and Doucoure) who combined for 31 points, but he wasn’t able to
		capture the same magic as last week. It’s ironic that Aston Villa
		actually won 7 - 2 this week, but his team didn’t benefit from the great
		performance.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>91.5 - 29.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Singapore Slingers took a convincing victory against Red Dragons this
		week. Red Dragons’ first-round pick Mane (LIV) got diagnosed with the
		coronavirus and wasn’t able to play this week. His team played very
		poorly and didn’t have a crazy performance from Vardy (LEI) to bail him
		out. He was unlucky to have 3 non-starters this week including Harrison
		(LEE) who was unable to play against his parent club Manchester City due
		to his loan deal. His best performer was Thiago Silva (CHE) with 12.5
		points. The center back looked much better partnered with Chelsea’s best
		defender so far this season, Zouma (CHE). Singapore Slingers on the
		other hand secured the win in large part to his 2 star performers this
		season, Calvert-Lewin (EVE) and Salah (LIV). They combined for 44 points
		this week. The rest of his team had fairly average performances this
		week, but new signing Dias (MCI) looks like he could be a good defender
		for the season. He is currently using Darlow as his only goalkeeper so
		he will need to look for another once Newcastle’s number one, Dubravka,
		comes back from injury.
