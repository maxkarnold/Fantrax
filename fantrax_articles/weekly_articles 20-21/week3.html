<p>
	The premier league didn’t disappoint again this week with goals galore. High
	scoring games and the controversial handball rule resulted in a difficult
	week for defenders. The three teams who were top of the league last week
	lost their games. With no title favorite appearing as of yet, the top should
	be much closer than last year.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Scary FC vs North London Troopz</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>42 - 100.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The reigning champion, North London Troopz, won against Scary FC by a
		very large margin. An intentional effort to play as many Aston Villa
		players as possible paid off. His Villa players combined for 60.5
		points. Troopz very much maximized his points with his only other double
		digit scorer being Mahrez (MCI) with 19.5 points. 6 of his starters
		scored less than 5 points and he’ll have to find another way to win as
		Villa are playing Liverpool next week. Scary FC will need to make some
		big moves in order to improve his team which had no standout performers
		with none scoring in the double digits. With many of his players either
		borderline starters or low scoring midfield players he should be looking
		to trade one of his goalkeepers in a package deal for a star player.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>82.25 - 54.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Mourinho Out won by 28 points against 30 Yard Screamers with 50 points
		sitting on his bench. Mourinho Out didn’t have any stand out performers,
		but had decent performances from Tielemans (LEI), Townsend (CRY), and
		Kane (TOT). Another lackluster Manchester United performance hurt 30
		Yard Screamers with only 6.25 points combined from Martial (MUN) and Wan
		Bissaka (MUN). He also had 2 non-starters and 0 points from Hélder Costa
		(LEE) who had been a standout performer for him in past weeks.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Singapore Slingers vs 2 Goals 1 Cup</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>57.5 - 60</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		2 Goals 1 Cup got the win against Singapore Slingers in the closest
		match of the week. Slingers can count himself unlucky as Coady (WOL) had
		-8 points thanks to West Ham’s thrashing of Wolves. Slingers could have
		started Lamptey (BHA) who was on his bench with 8.25 points, which would
		have given him 16.25 more points. Slingers will hope to get more of his
		players playing as he had 6 players who didn’t play this week. 2 Goals 1
		Cup got his first win of the season with an all around balanced
		performance from his team. The standout performer for him was Lucas
		(TOT) with 17 points which might be thanks to the looming competition
		from new Tottenham signing Gareth Bale. He’ll be happy about this win,
		with five players who didn’t play, including potential game changers in
		Pulisic (CHE), van Aanholt (CRY), and Redmond (SOU).

	<h2>
		<strong><em>PuroAme vs Wan Young McTominaytor</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>29.5 - 67.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A very poor week from PuroAme saw him lose to Wan Young Mctominaytor by
		over 30 points. He had 7 players who didn’t play this week for injuries
		or other reasons. The players who did start for him were disappointing
		in general, with -3 points from his star man Raul Jimenez (WOL) and
		-5.25 points from his goalkeeper Ederson (MCI). On the bright side,
		he’ll hope that Abraham (CHE) can play more regularly thanks to his goal
		and a team shake-up from Frank Lampard. Wan Young McTominaytor did well
		this week with a balanced performance from his team with no real
		standout performers. Praet (LEI) has been excellent so far this season,
		but might be getting a real set back thanks to an injury and the
		reintroduction of Maddison (LEI).

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs AC Aläcrân</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>96.75 - 74.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Red Dragons continued a good run of form to beat AC Aläcrân this week in
		large part due to 42.5 points from star striker Jamie Vardy (LEI).
		Dragons has some real big star performers on his team with other players
		Mane (LIV) and Harrison (LEE) scoring 40.5 points combined. Dragons has
		some large holes in his team with little depth on his bench and -11.5
		points from his goalkeeper and two center backs. AC Aläcrân who was
		previously undefeated can count himself unlucky to face Red Dragons this
		week. He had the most points of any losing team this week and would have
		beaten two teams that won this week. A lack of defensive options really
		cost him this week with only one defender, Alexander-Arnold (LIV),
		scoring positive points this week. McGinn (AVL) had 21.5 points on his
		bench and would have made the matchup a lot closer had he started.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>So Long GAY BOiii FC vs Maximum Arteta</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>61.5 - 86</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Maximum Arteta took victory against So Long GAY BOiii FC in a close game
		until the final day. Great performances from both Grealish (AVL) and
		Zambo Anguissa (FUL) helped take the lead, while poor performances from
		Willian (ARS), Mitrovic (FUL), and Areola (FUL) sunk S.L.G.B. ‘s hopes
		of staying top of the league. Maximum Arteta had a lot of decent
		performances, but had -8.5 points from Mendy (MCI). His top performer
		was Bruno Fernandes (MUN) who scored a penalty in the last second of the
		game against Brighton. S.L.G.B. had a lot of good performers on his
		bench, notably March (BHA) with 21.5 points. S.L.G.B. started Rudiger
		(CHE) who didn’t play in his game. With so many good players on his
		team, I expect S.L.G.B. to be one of the main title challengers this
		season.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs #TindallBall</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>101 - 26.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In the most lopsided matchup this week – top scoring team – SAMURAI
		BOMBER cruised to victory against the lowest scoring team, #TindallBall.
		#TindallBall started 3 players who didn’t play and had disappointing
		performances from his star players. The only player on his team to score
		more than 4 points was Ings (SOU) with 12.5 points. Sterling was
		especially disappointing playing in his makeshift role up front with 0.5
		points. SAMURAI BOMBER was able to get his first win of the season with
		highest points in the entire league. It was a great overall performance
		from his team with his one standout performer being Mason Mount (CHE)
		with 23 points. He’ll hope that Mount keeps up his good form so that
		this wasn’t a fluke performance. Three injuries to SAMURAI BOMBER’s
		starting lineup this week will be very disappointing. He should look to
		pick up the potential backups for these players.
