<p>
	A very high scoring week in the Premier League saw a large variation in
	scores throughout the FPL. Highlighted by another great week from So Long
	Gay Boiii which put him in first place and a point explosion for Mourinho
	Out!, thanks to 40+ point performances from Son (TOT) and Kane (TOT).

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out! vs Scary FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>143.75 - 72</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In a massive 71 point victory, “Mourinho Out!” was probably saying
		“Mourinho In!” as Son (TOT) and Kane (TOT) combined for a whopping 92
		points! They were involved in all 5 of Tottenham’s goals. Although he
		had a great week with other great performances, his defense and
		goalkeeper combined for only 4.75 points and could be an area to be
		looked at in the future. Scary FC didn’t do horrible with 72 points with
		good performances from Ceballos (ARS) and Digne (EVE). He’ll be hopeful
		Donny van de Beek can be a regular starter going forward for Manchester
		United.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>53.5 - 106</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC will be thinking “this is the year” after his 50+
		point victory over last year’s regular season champion North London
		Troopz. He had several draft picks that have turned out well for him
		including Willian (ARS), Klich (LEE), Castagne (LEI), and Mitrovic
		(FUL). Spending all $100 of his waiver budget on James Rodriguez (EVE)
		may have been seen as a gamble at the time but it paid off as James
		scored 15+ points for the second straight week and it took the Colombian
		international no time to adjust to the premier league and Everton. On
		the other side, North London Troopz will be disappointed as several
		players performed below par. Mahrez (MCI), Doucoure (EVE), and Zouma
		(CHE) combined for 0.5 points. However, his last round draft pick
		Martinez (AVL) seems to have worked out as the goalkeeper scored 19
		points on his debut for his new team. North London Troopz can count
		himself unlucky for a lot of reasons, but seems unlikely to repeat last
		year’s dominance.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs PuroAme</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>42.5 - 55.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A red card to both Bissouma (BHA) and a -5.25 performance from Lewis
		(NEW) saw Maximum Arteta fall short in a low scoring affair against
		PuroAme. Having Diangana (WBA) score 17 points on his bench will have
		him frustrated he didn’t play him. PuroAme best performer was Chris Wood
		(BUR) with 15 points thanks to a goal, two shots on target, and four
		aerials. Ultimately a goal from Raúl Jiménez sealed the win.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>#TindallBall vs Red Dragons</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>81.75 - 85</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		In the closest game of the week, Red Dragons was led by Zaha (CRY) and
		Mané, scoring a combined 54 points with 2 goals each. #TindallBall had 3
		players over 20 points - Alisson (LIV), Ings (SOU), and Barnes (LEI) -
		but a red card from Sheffield United defender John Egan and no positive
		points from any of his other defenders saw him fall short by 3.25 points
		to Red Dragons.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>2 Goals 1 Cup vs Wan Young McTominaytor</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>29.25 - 94.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A one sided matchup was exacerbated when De Bruyne (MCI) scored 38
		points for Wan Young McTominaytor in the last game of the week. 2 Goals
		1 Cup had a very poor week with only Werner (CHE) and Firmino (LIV)
		scoring over 10 points. Mctominaytor will be pleased with the pickup of
		Dennis Praet (LEI) who has scored over 10 points in two straight weeks.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>30 Yard Screamers vs SAMURAI BOMBER</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>74.75 - 59</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		30 Yard Screamers got his second win of the year after getting a fairly
		close 74.75 - 59 victory. He’ll be happy with a 23 point performance
		from Hélder Costa (LEE) and a solid 8.5 points from Reed (FUL). Although
		Martial (MUN) only scored -1.5 points for him, his victory was helped by
		a Manchester United collapse to Crystal Palace. His opponent SAMURAI
		BOMBER had Rashford, Fosu-Mensah, and De Gea (all from Manchester
		United) scoring a combined 7 points. BOMBER’s highest scoring player was
		Trézéguet (AVL) with only 13 points. He’ll hope for better luck next
		week as he searches for his first win of the season.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>AC Aläcrân vs Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>110 - 74.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A substantial victory from AC Aläcrân saw him move into second place and
		in the process sending down the former leader in the standings to fifth.
		Solid games from all his players saw him scoring 110 points. His lowest
		scoring player was Sander Berge (SHU) with 4.5. Singapore Slingers had
		one standout player in Calvert-Lewin (EVE) score 34 points, but didn’t
		get much from his other players including Salah (LIV) who didn’t manage
		to get a goal or assist after his hat trick last week.
