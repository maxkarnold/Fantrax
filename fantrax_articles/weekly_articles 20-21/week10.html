	Maximum Arteta upset thanks to El Matador heroics

<p>
	Injuries have really hit their toll on the premier league teams this season.
	Fixture congestion has caused managers to use their subs early and often as
	seen this weekend where three managers used two subs at halftime. SAMURAI
	BOMBER suffered a season-ending injury to one of his best players van Dijk
	(LIV) but won a surprise victory over Maximum Arteta to get his second win
	in a row. It's still fairly early in the season, but Mourinho Out got his
	ninth win in a row to stay in first place in the standings. Wan Young
	McTominaytor is right behind him with 8 wins, while PuroAme got his fourth
	victory in a row to be tied for third.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs Maximum Arteta</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>109.5 - 97.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A major upset was pulled thanks to the heroics of "El Matador" (nickname
		for Edinson Cavani (MUN)). SAMURAI BOMBER won a close victory in the
		highest-scoring matchup of the week. Cavani didn't start for Manchester
		United, but was brought on at halftime and scored two goals and assisted
		one to win the game for Manchester United. If Cavani can get more game
		time, he could be a really good fantasy scorer. It is more likely,
		however, that this will be his highest points total of the season. Other
		big performers for SAMURAI BOMBER were Rashford (MUN) and Furlong (WBA)
		combining for 39.5 points. SAMURAI BOMBER also had some decent
		performances on his bench with Fred (MUN) scoring 7.5 and Welbeck (BHA)
		scoring 14.5. Antonee Robinson (FUL) was a good pickup earlier in the
		season. He's been very consistent not scoring under 3 points this season
		which is very good for a defender. After being in second place for a
		little while, Maximum Arteta will be disappointed to fall down to third
		thanks to this loss. He had no goalkeeper this week thanks to an injury
		to Pope (BUR), which may or may not have made a difference since
		Manchester City blew out Burnley. His standout performer was Grealish
		(AVL) with 28.5 points. He had a good performance overall with 4 other
		players in double digits. However,, his defense only combined for 12.5
		points this week, and Maddison (LEI) struggled after a good performance
		last week. Leicester City is still trying to figure out its best lineup
		thanks to some really key injuries to players like Castagne, Pereira,
		Söyüncü, and Ndidi.

		<strong><em>So Long GAY BOiii FC vs AC Aläcrân</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>66.25 - 76.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		AC Aläcrân won a fairly close victory against So Long GAY BOiii FC
		putting him ahead in the standings. SLGB FC is on a bad run of form
		lately with less than 70 points in two straight games. He only had three
		players in double digits this week with one of them a new pickup. Stones
		(MCI) received just his second start of the season but was able to make
		the most of it, keeping a clean sheet and scoring 16.5 points. SLGB FC
		is struggling with injuries with four players out. It's hard to pin his
		struggles on any one player, but the recent form of Mitrovic (FUL) and
		Sterling (MCI) has not helped. Sterling was rested after England duty
		and was rested again this week after playing in the Champions League.
		Sterling overall has had only two games in double digits in a
		disappointing start to the campaign. Manchester City has an easier run
		of fixtures coming up and Sterling should make it back into the starting
		XI despite poor performances. Mitrovic also hasn't started two straight
		games and also had a decent amount of games during the international
		break. Fulham was able to defeat Leicester City for only their second
		win of the season despite Mitrovic playing only four minutes. SLGB FC
		sits at 5-5 despite having the fourth-best points total in the league.
		I'd expect his team to pick up form and continue to be a playoff
		contender as the season goes on. AC Aläcrân's standout performer in the
		matchup was Ward-Prowse (SOU) with 21 points. Ward-Prowse is in really
		good form this year and is deadly from free kicks with both of
		Southampton's goals coming from his delivery. AC Aläcrân also had
		double-digit performances from Richarlison (EVE) and Raphinha (LEE).
		Raphinha has started his second game in a row now and seems to have
		forced Hélder Costa to the bench. An average performance was good enough
		for AC Aläcrân to get the victory in a low-scoring week.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out vs North London Troopz</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>109.75 - 85.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Mourinho Out defeated North London Troopz in the Hackberry Derby. A
		close matchup until Monday, Mourinho Out surged ahead with Cash (AVL)
		and Bowen (WHU) combining for 33.25 points. Meanwhile, North London
		Troopz played Fabiański (WHU), Fornals (WHU), and Hourihane (AVL),
		combining for only 8 points. It was undoubtedly an excellent performance
		from Mahrez (MCI) that kept him in the matchup with 45 points. Mahrez
		scored a hattrick in Manchester City's convincing victory over Burnley.
		North London Troopz will hope Mahrez can continue his form into the
		season as he'll need Mahrez to continue to score well with so many other
		struggling players. This includes his first round pick Aubameyang (ARS),
		who has only averaged 6.5 points this season and continued to do poorly
		this week with only 2 points. On the positive side for North London
		Troopz, he decided to drop Martinez (AVL) and start Fabiański who scored
		8 points. He's also finally gotten Telles (MUN) and Torres (MCI) into
		the starting lineups for their respective teams. Telles looks to be a
		lock for Manchester United, while Torres continues to get game time in
		Guardiola's rotated Manchester City side. For Mourinho Out, what started
		off as an average game week ended in the most points scored in the
		league in the starting lineup and the bench. Even though bench points
		don't count for anything in the FPL, having options on your bench is
		very important because of matchups and injuries. Barring a few major
		injuries to his team, Mourinho Out looks like a lock to be in the
		playoffs already and to be the favorite to win the whole thing. Mourinho
		Out's ninth win in a row kept him top of the table, while North London
		Troopz remained in eighth, tied with three other teams.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs Wan Young McTominaytor</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>66.5 - 105.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor put in another impressive performance to secure
		victory over Red Dragons. Wan Young McTominaytor's top performers were
		De Bruyne (MCI) and Mendy (MCI) combining for 42.75 points. Both
		benefitted from a great Manchester City performance, which was most
		likely a great prediction by McTominaytor as he picked up Mendy before
		the game started. Mendy has been very poor this season and was benched
		for Cancelo (MCI) earlier in the season. Wan Young McTominaytor has now
		won six in a row and is now solely in second place behind the leader
		Mourinho Out. However, there are some worrying signs from Wan Young
		McTominaytor despite the continued success. Many of his players are
		borderline starters despite strong fantasy performances. This also
		includes his bench which has some very talented players in Bale (TOT),
		Havertz (CHE), and Traore (AVL), which have all seen minimal playtime as
		of late. Although it's unlikely that most of his players will all of the
		sudden be all benched during the same week, especially with more player
		rotation expected from premier league teams, it's something to keep an
		eye on as the season progresses. On the other side, Red Dragons had a
		disappointing performance and have now lost four games in a row to put
		him tenth in the table. Performances from his team have not been bad
		once again, but injuries have hurt as well as a lack of squad depth. An
		injury suffered by Digne (EVE) and a positive coronavirus case for Zaha
		(CRY) meant he only played with 8 starting players. Mane (LIV) was
		rested for Liverpool's game against Brighton and scored a goal off the
		bench, only for it to be ruled out for offsides. Red Dragons had three
		players on double digits this week, including Harrison (LEE), who has
		been very impressive so far this season. Red Dragons also had Ogbonna on
		his bench with 19.5 points thanks to a header he scored in West Ham's
		victory.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Scary FC vs #TindallBall</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>60.75 - 67.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		#TindallBall defeated Scary FC in his second victory in a row. A close
		matchup where every point mattered, #Tindallball had four players in
		double digits. One of those was Podence (WOL) with 15 points. Podence
		has been #Tindallball's best player behind Ings (SOU), in what seems to
		be one of the steals of the draft as a 13th round pick. Another huge
		impact was that Barnes (LEI) didn't start this week, but came off the
		bench to score a goal and 11 points. Willian's (ARS) 10 points shouldn't
		be overlooked in what was his best performance since the first game of
		the season. For Scary FC, he'll be very disappointed as only two of his
		players scored in the double digits. Neto (WOL) and Vardy (LEI) combined
		for 28.5 points this week, but it wasn't enough to secure the victory.
		Undoubtedly, a reason for the loss was the benching of Cancelo (MCI) by
		Guardiola. Manchester City smashed Burnley in a 5-0 victory in which
		Cancelo was most likely rested. Cancelo has been doing really well in
		real life and in fantasy this year and will most likely get the start in
		next week's match.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>PuroAme vs Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>61 - 46</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		PuroAme defeated Singapore Slingers in a low scoring matchup this week.
		PuroAme has been unfortunate with a lot of injuries this season and
		suffered two more this week with both Abraham (CHE) and Jimenez (WOL)
		going down with injuries. PuroAme's standout performer was undoubtedly
		Lookman (FUL) with 19.5 points. Chilwell (CHE) had another good game
		with 12 points and is now the highest-scoring defender in the league.
		Other players on his team that have done well were pretty poor this week
		and Cavaleiro (FUL) was on his bench with 15 points. However, I'd give
		him some slack as he didn't have enough forward positions to play him
		without removing another forward. Singapore Slingers had a very poor
		week with just his goalkeeper, Darlow (NEW), scoring in double digits.
		He played four defenders this week with a combined total of 4.5 points.
		Two of them had negative points, while Ait-Nouri (WOL) didn't start in
		the game for Wolves. He also had 27 points on the bench from Joelinton.
		A worrying week for Singapore Slingers as he started the season really
		well and scored a lot of points, but is now cooling down and not
		catching any breaks.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>2 Goals 1 Cup vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>34.25 - 48</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The lowest scoring matchup of the week saw 30 Yard Screamers defeating 2
		Goals 1 Cup despite scoring below 50 points. 30 Yard Screamers only had
		one player in double digits this week. That player was his goalkeeper
		Johnstone (WBA) who scored 19.5 points, although he also had Wilson
		(NEW) on his bench with 19 points. 30 Yard Screamers did have Baldock
		(SHU) scoring 8.75 points and Reed (FUL) scoring 9.5 points. But he had
		a disappointing performance from his other players, with 8 players
		scoring under 3 points including Jorginho (CHE) who didn't play and has
		seen his playing time dropped drastically as of late. 2 Goals 1 Cup had
		no players in double digits and had most of his points coming from his
		midfield today. His midfielders combined for 28.5 of his 34.25 total
		points. Despite his team's lack of success, the trade for Solly March
		has been very beneficial as March has consistently scored well,
		averaging 10 points per game this season. Another recent trade, where 2
		Goals 1 Cup traded Redmond for Maupay has not started well. Maupay was
		injured after he also missed a penalty in Brighton's draw with
		Liverpool.
