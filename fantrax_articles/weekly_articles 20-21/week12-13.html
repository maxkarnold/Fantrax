	Three teams fight for top and SLGB FC resurgence
</h1>

<!-- intro paragraph -->
<p>
	In a special edition of the FPL Recap, I look at the past two gameweeks and
	the best matches from both. The top teams dropped points over these two
	weeks and three teams sit tied on ten wins at the top of the table. Both AC
	Al&auml;cran and SLGB FC have done well as of late, especially SLGB FC. SLGB
	FC has seen a resurgence to his point totals with 112 and 128.5 points
	respectively. His points total is second best in the league and sits just
	two games behind the first place spot. I wouldn't sleep on SLGB FC being a
	serious contender for the FPL title. Five teams sit on five wins for the
	season, it should be interesting to see which of these teams could be
	playoff contenders.

			><em>Mourinho Out vs Wan Young McTominaytor: Week 12</em>
		</strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>90.25 - 92.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor was able to defeat Mourinho Out in a close
		victory. This win put Wan Young McTominaytor to first in the league
		table for the first time this season. Any small mistake could have seen
		this result go the other way, but he could have had a much easier time
		if he played James Justin (LEI). The Leicester City full-back had the
		best game of his season with 23.25 points but was left on the bench by
		Wan Young McTominaytor. He played four other defenders who all scored
		less with Walker-Peters (SOU) scoring the most with 11 points.
		McTominaytor's top scorer this week was Martinez (AVL) the goalkeeper
		with 22 points. He made seven saves and got a clean sheet in Aston
		Villa's victory. McTominaytor made a very smart pickup this week with
		Almiron (NEW) and did a good job to play him. Almiron scored 17.5 points
		in Newcastle's victory over West Brom in his highest-scoring game of the
		season. Jota (LIV) is still injured and is a big loss for McTominaytor,
		but he's managing to still do well. Mourinho Out's team had a decent
		performance, but a few decisions could have got him the victory. His
		highest scoring defender was Walker (MCI), who was on his bench with
		12.5 points. He would have gotten 11.25 points more if he had played him
		instead of Dier (TOT). Another potential change was to put in Shelvey
		(NEW) or Redmond (SOU) for one of his midfielders. Redmond didn't start
		the game for Southampton but managed to score a goal off the bench.
		Shelvey just had a good all-around performance in Newcastle's win
		against West Brom. Mourinho Out's best player this week was Kane (TOT)
		with 17.5 points. Kane has been outstanding this season and is the
		highest scoring player so far.

		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs Maximum Arteta: Week 12</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>53 - 155.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A dominant performance from Maximum Arteta was enough to defeat North
		London Troopz by over 100 points. Maximum Arteta scored the most points
		in a single week this season with 155.25 points. He had four players
		with 20+ points and also Schlupp (CRY) with 20.5 points on his bench. A
		big reason for the great performance was Burnley's 1-0 victory over
		Arsenal. Maximum Arteta ironically bet against his own favorite team and
		was rewarded with clean sheets for Pope, Mee, and Brownhill from
		Burnley. Other big performances came from Bednarek (SOU) and Maddison
		(LEI), who both scored a season-high in points this week. For North
		London Troopz, his defeat was exacerbated by the benching of Romeu (SOU)
		and Mings (AVL) combining for 30.25 points on the bench. A worrying sign
		for North London Troopz is that both Laporte (MCI) and Telles (MUN)
		didn't play and their teams played a 0-0 draw. Those were opportunities
		for clean sheets and they're likely to be rotated within their own
		squads more. On the positive side, Pogba (MUN) has now started two
		straight games for Manchester United. If Pogba can keep playing
		regularly, he's likely to provide a lot of fantasy value and maybe even
		justify his high draft selection. A familiar sight for his team as Zouma
		(CHE) was again his team's top scorer and his top draft pick, Aubamayeng
		(ARS), had a horrible game scoring an own goal. North London Troopz also
		made a big decision to drop his other goalkeeper, Martinez (AVL), and
		stick with Fabi&aacute;nski (WHU). Fabi&aacute;nski had a decent week,
		but meanwhile, Martinez (AVL) scored 22 points this week for Wan Young
		McTominaytor. We'll see if he made the right choice as the season goes
		on.

		<strong><em>Scary FC vs Singapore Slingers: Week 12</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>98 - 104</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Singapore Slingers ended a six-game losing streak and defeated Scary FC
		in a close match. A balanced performance from his whole team led to the
		win with six players in double digits. His top scorer was Tarkowski
		(BUR) with 15 points. A big miss was Lamptey's absence, but luckily for
		Slingers, it didn't matter in the end. His other defenders did very well
		combining for 24.75 points this week. It was also a good week for his
		forwards, who combined for 32.5 points. He also had 17 points from
		forwards on his bench. Scary FC had a pretty good this week but may have
		made a mistake to play Luiz (AVL) who got a red card in the game,
		scoring -1 points. Had he played McArthur (CRY) or Allan (EVE) instead,
		he would have won the match. Vardy (LEI) was his top scorer this week
		with 26.5 points. He also had good performances from 3 of his 4
		defenders, who got clean sheets. Schmeichel (LEI) also did well to get a
		clean sheet. Cancelo (MCI) has been really good so far this season and
		has averaged 11.9 points per game. The trouble is that Manchester City
		always seems to rotate their players, so the value of City players could
		be higher, but isn't.

		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs PuroAme: Week 12</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>80.5 - 77.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		SAMURAI BOMBER defeated PuroAme in a close match. For SAMURAI BOMBER,
		his top performers were all in defense and in goal. The goalkeeper and
		three defenders combined for 45.5 points. His top scorer was Furlong
		(WBA), with a goal in West Brom's loss against Newcastle. Furlong has
		been fairly good this year and has been a good pickup by SAMURAI BOMBER.
		Another good pickup by SAMURAI BOMBER has been Robinson (FUL), another
		defender from a newly promoted team. Robinson has been the best scoring
		defender for Fulham, averaging 7.9 points per game. SAMURAI BOMBER
		didn't have many options on his bench, with only Meslier (LEE) on his
		bench scoring points. Meanwhile, for PuroAme, he had both Keane (EVE)
		and Cavaleiro (FUL) scoring over 7 points on his bench. Had one of them
		played, perhaps he could have gotten the victory this week. Chilwell
		(CHE) had his worst performance of the season so far. Chilwell has been
		excellent so far this season, averaging 12 points per game, the most by
		any defender with more than three games played. His best performer this
		week was Godfrey (EVE) who may have surprisingly won a clean sheet
		against Chelsea. Thanks to injuries to Everton's full-backs, Godfrey has
		been able to get a lot of game time and has shown a lot of versatility
		in defense. Ndidi (LEI) made his first start for Leicester since
		September after a lengthy injury. The Leicester City midfielder racks up
		defensive stats and should be a big boost for PuroAme going forward.

				>Wan Young McTominaytor vs North London Troopz: Week 13
			</em></strong
		>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>88.5 - 96</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		North London Troopz pulled off a huge upset to defeat first-place Wan
		Young McTominaytor. Ryan Fraser (NEW) had his best performance of the
		season with 17.5 points and was one of North London Troopz' four players
		in double digits. Aubamayeng (ARS), also had a decent game, with his
		best performance since his goal against Manchester United. North London
		Troopz' best performer was Holgate (EVE) with 21.25 points. The defender
		was a last-minute pickup and the move paid off big time. Surprisingly,
		Zouma (CHE) had one of his worst performances so far this season, only
		scoring 3.25 points. Zouma has been consistently North London Troopz'
		best player but had a bad game. Luckily for him, it didn't cost his
		team, but Wan Young McTominaytor had a good chance of winning this one.
		He didn't play Aurier (TOT) or Traore (AVL) this week, who combined for
		16.75 points on his bench. Wan Young McTominaytor had a lot of
		outstanding performances and a lot of poor performances this week. His
		top scorer was Rodrigo (LEE) with 19.5 points. He also made a good move
		and picked up Nketiah (ARS) before Arsenal's game. Nketiah scored a
		season-high 12.5 points, making a good contribution to the team. Havertz
		(CHE) was a particularly bad performer this week with -1 points. Havertz
		was a second-round pick this year and probably hasn't lived up to the
		expectations many had for him coming into the league. Another
		disappointment was Watkins (AVL), with his second-worst performance of
		the season, scoring only 2 points. Wan Young McTominaytor is still a
		dangerous team to look out for, but his squad rotation will mean there
		will be inconsistencies along the way.

			><em>So Long GAY BOiii FC vs SAMURAI BOMBER: Week 13</em>
		</strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>128.5 - 101.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC had the most points scored this week in an
		impressive win over SAMURAI BOMBER. SAMURAI BOMBER scored over 100
		points this week and would have beaten any other opponent except for
		Maximum Arteta. El Ghazi (AVL) and Hause (AVL) were great pickups by
		SLGB FC, combining for 36.75 points this week. El Ghazi was SLGB FC's
		top performer and managed it all without a goal or assist. He had a
		great performance from his team all-round with no player scoring below 5
		points. His performance was so good it's hard to imagine he could have
		done any better, but he could have with Firmino (LIV) on his bench with
		21 points. That was Firmino's best performance of the season. Boly (WOL)
		was also on his bench and scored 10.25 points in a good performance. You
		could say SAMURAI BOMBER managed the match as well as he could, as his
		entire bench had 0 points. He made some good decisions to pick up De
		Cordova-Reid (FUL) and Murphy (NEW), who combined for 18.5 points this
		week. His best performer by far this week was Rashford (MUN), who scored
		28 points with two goals. Walcott (SOU) also had one of his better games
		this season with 17 points, scoring a goal against his former team
		Arsenal. Mount (CHE) was a risky draft pick for SAMURAI BOMBER this year
		but has worked out so far. However, Mount had his worst game of the
		season this week, which didn't help his chances against SLGB FC. SAMURAI
		BOMBER also made a mistake to play Fernandinho (MCI), who didn't play
		against West Brom.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs Scary FC: Week 13</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>82.5 - 77</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Red Dragons prevailed over Scary FC in a very close matchup. Red
		Dragons' best player was Harrison (LEE) with 24.5 points. He had three
		other players in double digits, including a good pickup in Olsen (EVE).
		Everton's usual goalkeeper, Pickford (EVE), was benched for the game and
		Red Dragons took the opportunity to pick up Olsen and got 12.5 points
		from that. Red Dragons' typical top performers didn't do so well this
		week: with Mane (LIV), Zaha (CRY), James (CHE), and Silva (CHE)
		combining for only 4.75 points. Scary FC had a chance in this game and
		suffered a huge blow when Allan (EVE) went down with an injury, only
		scoring 1.5 points. It also didn't help that Vardy (LEI) only scored 5.5
		points this week and Wan-Bissaka (MUN) scored -1.5 points. Scary FC's
		best player was Dallas (LEE) this week, he scored a goal and 17.5
		points. Neto (WOL) also did well this week, scoring 17 points and
		scoring a goal. Neto has done very well this season and probably would
		surprise people that he is Wolves' top fantasy scorer so far. Wolves'
		best player last year was Raul Jimenez and also had two other players in
		the top ten scorers (Traore and Doherty). Neto was Wolves' tenth best
		player last season, only averaging 3.86 points per game. This season
		he's averaging 11.2 points per game and is the 13th highest scorer in
		the league. Neto was drafted in the 17th round this year and could
		already be seen as one of the steals of the draft.
