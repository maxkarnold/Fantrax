	Scary FC wins 2nd in a row after Vardy trade
</h1>

<!-- intro paragraph -->
<p>
	The premier league is starting to look normal again, with Liverpool top of
	the table. Meanwhile in the FPL there's finally a team that sits alone at
	the top with the best record in the league. Mourinho Out won his sixth game
	in a row and with a record of 6-1 after Maximum Arteta lost this week. There
	weren't many close games this week, but there was almost a tie between
	SAMURAI BOMBER and 2 Goals 1 Cup. The two teams were tied in points, but
	after the points were recalculated SAMURAI BOMBER managed to win by 1 point.
	A big trade that may have gone under the radar this week, was the swap of
	Vardy (LEI) and Digne (EVE).

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Scary FC vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>101 - 47</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Scary FC defeated So Long GAY BOiii FC in a dominating performance. It
		was not a good week for SLGB FC as he had only two players in double
		digits. Mitrovic (FUL) had 15.5 points and Vestergaard (SOU) had 11.75
		points. SLGB FC had a lot of key players out in this game, including
		Castagne (LEI) and Rodriguez (EVE) who were both injured and he benched
		Souceck (WHU) and Traore (WOL), who have both been underperforming as of
		late. Some of the players he traded for a few weeks back, did not do
		well either. Sterling (MCI) scored just 6.5 points, Firmino (LIV) scored
		-0.5 points and van Aanholt's (CRY) first game back from injury was a -1
		point performance. On the other side, Scary FC traded away suspended
		defender Digne (EVE) for forward Vardy (LEI). Digne didn't play this
		week and Vardy was actually the highest scoring player on his team this
		week, with 24.5 points. Time will see if the trade will work out in the
		long run, but for the time being it seems like a good trade for Scary
		FC, who's won two in a row. Scary FC had some outstanding performances
		from players who are on good form recently. Cancelo (MCI) has started
		the last 3 games for Manchester City and scored 15+ points in all of
		them. Partey looked good in his second start this year with 10.5 points
		to add a good contribution to Scary FC's team.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs AC Aläcrân</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>82.75 - 106.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A top of the table clash that didn't disappoint, saw AC Aläcrân defeat
		Maximum Arteta in the highest scoring matchup of the week. AC Aläcrân
		got off to a terrific start after the first game, in which his 3 Wolves
		players scored a combined 44.25 points. Ait Nouri (WOL) got his first
		start of the season and it actually came at the cost of one of Maximum
		Arteta's own defenders. The other exceptional performance for AC Aläcrân
		was definitely Ward-Prowse (SOU) scoring a season high 32.5 points. AC
		Aläcrân is still waiting for both Richarlison (EVE) and Söyüncü (LEI) to
		come back from suspension/injury so I'd expect this team to continue to
		do well throughout the season. On the other side, Maximum Arteta had a
		few disappointing performances, especially Fernandes (MUN) and Pereira
		(WBA) who combined for a miniscule 3.5 points. The matchup wouldn't have
		been as close if it wasn't for Grealish (AVL), who had another great
		week scoring 31 points. Maximum Arteta had another injury to a defender
		this week, so he'll go into next week with only 3 of his defenders
		available.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Mourinho Out vs Red Dragons</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>118.75 - 37.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		It was a lopsided matchup this week between the highest scoring team and
		the lowest. Mourinho Out easily dispatched Red Dragons to remain top of
		the table and stop Red Dragons good run of form. Red Dragons had made a
		big trade during the week to give up Vardy (LEI) for Digne (EVE). The
		trade was risky and it's hard to know whether it will be good business
		until Digne comes back from suspension. On the positive side for Red
		Dragons, Vardy wouldn't have been enough for him to win this week as
		many of his other player didn't perform this week. A very surprising
		decision from Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, saw Red Dragons' keeper
		Pickford benched this week. Whether, that is a sign of things to come,
		who knows, but with the transfer window closed I see Pickford retaining
		his number 1 spot until January at least. Red Dragons still had some
		decent performances this week with Harrison (LEE), James (CHE), and Mane
		(LIV) combining for 34.5 points. However, this was almost all his points
		and Red Dragons only played 8 out of the possible 11 players possible.
		Red Dragons had some decent performers on the bench, including Silva
		(CHE), Holding (ARS), and Thomas (LEI) combining for 28 points. Thomas
		actually got his first start of the season, but still shouldn't remain
		on Red Dragons' team. Thomas was auto-drafted by Red Dragons at the
		beginning of the season and perhaps that investment has made Red Dragons
		reluctant to drop the young defender. For Mourinho Out, many good
		performers throughout his team helped him to the most points in the
		league this week. Even though Everton did poor this week, Calvert-Lewin
		(EVE) supplied his first points for Mourinho Out getting a nice goal and
		scoring 19.5 points. He also got double digit points from Kane (TOT),
		Semedo (WOL), Walker (MCI), Tielemans (LEI), and Townsend (CRY). There
		were also some disappointments with Cash now scoring -4.25 points since
		Mourinho Out traded for him. Maupay (BHA) was also left out of the
		Brighton squad this weekend, but isn't suffering from an injury. Whether
		that means he could have COVID-19 or had personal reasons, he'll hope
		Maupay can return next week.

		<strong><em>#TindallBall vs Wan Young McTominaytor</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>73.5 - 80.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A fairly close matchup saw a close victory for Wan Young McTominaytor
		over #TindallBall. A good performance from Barnes (LEI) with 14.5 points
		on Monday, wasn't good enough for #TindallBall to get the win.
		#TindallBall had another good performance from both Podence (WOL) and
		Ings (SOU) who have both been exceptional so far. Ings was injured this
		week, and while there's no news giving a time span of the injury,
		#TindallBall will hope Ings can stay fit. This is the second straight
		week #TindallBall got a close loss and you can see there might be
		potential for his team to pick up more points in the near future. On the
		other side, Wan Young McTominaytor gets his 3rd win in a row, with star
		player De Bruyne (MCI) playing a full game and scoring 16 points.
		Everyone knows the top scorer from last year can continue his great form
		and Wan Young McTominaytor just needs to put a decent team around him in
		order to keep getting wins and climbing the table. He actually made a
		brilliant play this week to use Bale (TOT), even though he was on the
		bench for Spurs this week. Bale repaid that faith by scoring to win the
		game for both Tottenham and Wan Young McTominaytor. Wan Young
		McTominaytor also had good performances from Watkins (AVL) and Saka
		(ARS), both scoring in double digits. His bench also did well scoring 32
		points.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>30 Yard Screamers vs PuroAme</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>68 - 76.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		PuroAme won in a close victory against 30 Yard Screamers with a big
		peformance from Ziyech (CHE) in his first start. Ziyech scored 20.5
		points and was PuroAme's best performer this week. PuroAme had a lot of
		average performances this week with only one other player scoring in
		double digits, Ederson (MCI), but decent performances all around helped
		him get the win. On the other side, 30 Yard Screamers will be glad that
		Martial's (MUN) suspension will be over in time for next weeks matchup.
		He only had 0.5 points total on his bench and had only 10 players who
		actually started this week. 30 Yard Screamers is going to need to bring
		in some new players in order to give his team some depth and hope that
		Antonio (WHU), probably his best player, comes back from his hamstring
		injury. He did have two great performances from his team despite the
		loss. Both Bellerin (ARS) and Wilson (NEW) scored in double digits.
		Wilson has been excellent so far this year and looks to have been the
		best new signing for Newcastle United this summer.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs 2 Goals 1 Cup</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>42 - 41</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		SAMURAI BOMBER claimed the closest victory of the season against 2 Goals
		1 Cup. The matchup was originally recorded as a tie by Fantrax, but
		after recalculations the victory was awarded to SAMURAI BOMBER. Perhaps
		it was a deserved victory for SAMURAI BOMBER as 2 Goals 1 Cup had only 6
		players who played this week. Both teams were dominated by contributors
		from Chelsea as Mount and Werner combined for 35.5 points, Mount for
		SAMURAI BOMBER and Werner for 2 Goals 1 Cup. The only other double digit
		performer from 2 Goals 1 Cup was Leno (ARS) with 14 points. SAMURAI
		BOMBER only had 2 other players with 5+ points, Lacazette (ARS) and
		Sigurdsson (EVE) combining for 13 points. Both teams did really poor
		this week, but if I had to choose a team to do well in the future, it
		would be 2 Goals 1 Cup. Pulisic (CHE), Redmond (SOU) and Greenwood (MUN)
		are all solid players for the season and I expect them to do well once
		they find form. However, that depends on the owners of the teams and
		whether or not they will invest into making improvements to their team.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>North London Troopz vs Singapore Slingers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>84.75 - 55.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Perhaps the marquee matchup last year, North London Troopz was able to
		defeat Singapore Slingers by almost 30 points. North London Troopz took
		full advantage of an off week for Singapore Slingers as his team
		performed well all around with no standout performers. Four players
		scored in double digits for NLTroopz as his faith in his Arsenal players
		paid off. His best performer was again, Zouma (CHE), who has
		consistently been his best player so far this season. Ferran Torres
		(MCI) started again this week, this time starting up front for the
		injured Aguero and Jesus. It doesn't look like Torres will earn a
		regular spot for the season, but is doing well as a stopgap for North
		London Troopz as are a lot of his players. Singapore Slingers had a few
		decent bench performers this week in Armstrong (SOU) and Coady (WOL).
		However, probably wouldn't have been enough as only two of his players
		scored in double digits. This was Salah (LIV) and Lamptey (BHA), which
		shouldn't be surprising as they have been Slingers' best two players
		this season. New acquisition Son (TOT) had only 5 points this week, but
		should expect better production next week when Tottenham plays West
		Bromwich Albion.
