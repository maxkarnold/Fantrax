	Watkins steals the show for Wan Young McTominaytor

<!-- intro paragraph -->
<p>
	It was quite an exciting weekend of football as there were two penalty kicks
	saved and one missed. Aston Villa thrashed Arsenal 3-0 and their great
	performances have translated into fantasy. Grealish (AVL) and Watkins (AVL)
	are both in the top ten players with the most points so far. Mourinho Out
	remained top of the table this week and there were no crazy upsets. Perhaps
	the best game was a close one between Wan Young McTominaytor and AC Aläcrân.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Wan Young McTominaytor vs AC AC Aläcrân</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>109.5 - 95</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor can thank a great performance from Ollie Watkins
		(AVL) in order to stretch his winning streak to four games after
		defeating AC Aläcrân. Watkins scored 27 points and is now 8th in points
		among all players with a game in hand. Dan Burn (BHA) had quite the
		exceptional game at left wing back, scoring 20 points in a makeshift
		role. Bale had his first start of the season for Tottenham and scored 7
		points, it looks like Bale will be starting from now on and should be a
		strong fantasy asset from here on out. I don't think anyone thought Jota
		(LIV) would be starting for Liverpool, except for Wan Young
		McTominaytor. Picking him up was a real steal. You could say
		McTominaytor managed his matchup perfectly this week with -10.5 points
		combined on his bench. On AC Aläcrân's bench was Alexander-Arnold, who
		you'd have to say has been very disappointing so far. Alexander-Arnold
		was drafted 6th overall in the draft and his performances have been
		poor. AC Aläcrân actually outscored McTominaytor in the last match with
		McGinn (AVL) and Barkley (AVL) combining for 30.5 points. One of his
		best performers was Coufal (WHU) with 17.75 points. Coufal has been
		fairly consistent so far in having a bad performance, followed by an
		excellent performance. Benrahma (WHU) was a great play for AC Aläcrân,
		as he scored 7 points off the bench for West Ham. Unfortunately for him
		he didn't score enough to beat Wan Young McTominaytor with his other
		defenders combining for 0.5 points.

		<strong><em>Singapore Slingers vs Maximum Arteta</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>87.75 - 128</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Maximum Arteta scored the most points in the league this week to hand
		Singapore Slingers his third straight loss. Slingers is now 10th in the
		league, which is astounding since he has scored the fourth most points
		in the league so far. It's clear that Slingers' luck hasn't been good so
		far as all the games he's lost were close. Slingers have actually only
		faced the 7th most points in the league, so his opponents just seem to
		score more than him recently. Eberechi Eze (CRY) was the highest scoring
		player for Slingers with 27 points. Eze has been in-and-out of the
		Crystal Palace starting lineup and a good performance like this might
		help him secure the spot from his main competiton, Schlupp (CRY).
		Slingers had Armstrong (SOU) on his bench this week with 25 points,
		while he had two players with 0 points starting. Perez (LEI) didn't play
		and Silva (MCI) didn't do much against Liverpool after coming on as a
		substitute. Son (TOT) hasn't exactly reached the heights of fantasy
		production he was hoping for after he traded for him. Since the trade,
		he has not won a game. Slingers boldly played 5 defenders this week,
		with 3 of the 5 recording clean sheets. Slingers had a decent week, but
		Maximum Arteta had the best week in the league. A solid backline
		performance from his keeper and defenders combined for 52.5 points. He
		also got 30 points from Fernandes (MUN), who is now 5th in fantasy
		scoring with a game in hand despite Manchester United's struggles this
		season. News of Pereira (WBA) getting COVID-19 came out this morning
		before the early game against Tottenham and didn't give Max Arteta much
		of a chance to switch up the lineup.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>SAMURAI BOMBER vs Mourinho Out</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>72.25 - 87.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A strong start from SAMURAI BOMBER wasn't enough to defeat league
		leader, Mourinho Out. In the final game of the weekend, Mourinho Out
		only needed 0.5 points in order to win. He had a choice between 3
		defenders and did excellent to choose the right one. Had he chosen
		Walker (MCI), who scored -4.5 points thanks to a penalty given up and a
		yellow card, SAMURAI BOMBER would have won this game. However, that's
		not what happenedand Mourinho Out was able to win a close one to stay
		top with another great performance from top scorer Kane (TOT). Kane has
		41 points more than the second highest scorer this season (although both
		Grealish and Fernandes are in the top 5 with a game in hand). Kane
		scored 23 points this week in a somewhat average performance from
		Mourniho Out's team. Gross was a good pickup from Mourinho Out, as he
		has scored in double digits for two straight games. Mourinho Out had
		Jesus (MCI) coming back from injury, which may have given him selection
		headaches as he could only play three forwards. Mourinho Out has a lot
		of talent in that position, perhaps it would be smart to trade one of
		his forwards for a different position. SAMURAI BOMBER finally got a
		decent performance from Rashford (MUN), who was one of his 3 players
		scoring double digits. Manchester United has really struggled this
		season, after finishing last season so strong. SAMURAI BOMBER's team is
		really lacking star power right now and Rashford is going to need to put
		up excellent games for him to win more. SAMURAI BOMBER looks like he's
		made an excellent pickup in Welbeck (BHA), the forward scored 9.5 points
		in his first start for Brighton despite no goal involvements.

		<strong><em>PuroAme vs #TindallBall</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>101.25 - 17.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A red hot PuroAme slaughtered #TindallBall with a fantastic defensive
		performance. #TindallBall scored the least points in a game this season
		with 17.75. PuroAme has had some excellent additions to his team
		recently, with players coming back from injury and gelling into their
		new teams. PuroAme only started 3 players that he also started in the
		first week this season (Abraham (CHE), Jimenez (WOL), and Keane (EVE)).
		Chilwell (LEI) and Reguilon (TOT) have been excellent since their
		integration into their respective teams. Ziyech has been a superstar so
		far with two straight 20+ point games. Abraham (CHE) has done excellent
		since making it into Chelsea's starting lineup. Lookman (FUL) has also
		been terrific, but this week had a penalty kick saved after he tried a
		panenka on Fabiánski. On the other side, #TindallBall played 4 players
		that didn't start and had subpar performances from the rest of his team.
		His highest scoring player was McTominay (MUN) with 6 points.
		#TindallBall actually had 30.75 points on his bench, which outscored his
		starting team.

		<strong><em>So Long GAY BOiii FC vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>107.25 - 28.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC defeated 30 Yard Screamers with a balanced
		performance from his entire team. SLGB's best performer was Souček (WHU)
		with 19.5 points. James Rodriguez scored his lowest amount in a game
		this week with 2.5, but other players picked up the slack. All his
		defenders and goalkeeper scored 10+ points as well as two of his
		midfielders. For 30 Yard Screamers, he had a number of disappointing
		performances this week. Martial (MUN) came back for his first game from
		his suspension and was awful. Martial has probably been one of the worst
		players in the league so far with -3.5 points, while also missing 3
		games thanks to a red card suspension. 30 Yard Screamers' best performer
		was Shaw (MUN) with 11 points. Shaw also picked up a little injury, but
		this is worrying as Shaw might lose his place in the starting eleven if
		Telles (MUN) comes in and performs. 30 Yard Screamers now has four
		injured players and will hope that they can all use the international
		break to recover.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs North London Troopz</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>35 - 53.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		North London Troopz defeated Red Dragons in the lowest scoring game of
		the week. North London Troopz was fairly lucky to play Red Dragons this
		week with the fifth worst points in the league. He can thank Fabiánski
		(WHU) for his penalty save in the 98th minute against Lookman (FUL) for
		the victory. Fabiánski's 22 points was the most from his team and had he
		not saved the penalty the game would have been very different. Fabiánski
		would have had 4 points instead, which would have still seen him won but
		by only a half point. His other standout performer was Romeu (SOU) with
		an excellent 13.5 points from midfield. The rest of his team was very
		poor and one his key players, Mahrez (MCI) was out of the matchday squad
		for no apparent reason. Zouma (CHE) had a surprisingly poor game this
		week, as I've mentioned in weeks prior, he has been North London Troopz
		best performer, but a 3 point performance was definitely a let down. For
		Red Dragons, it was an equally if not worse performance from him and his
		team. Red Dragons was missing Aguero and Trossard thanks to injury, but
		played both of them despite having two other players on his bench he
		could have played. Had Red Dragons played McNeil (BUR) and Silva (CHE),
		he would have won the game comfortably. Red Dragons top scorer was Zaha
		(CRY) with just 10 points followed closely by Mane (LIV) with 9.5
		points. Red Dragons may have made a smart decision by not playing Digne
		(EVE), who scored -2 points this week. That's two losses in a row for
		Red Dragons, scoring less than 40 points both weeks following his
		trading away of Vardy (LEI) for Digne (EVE). Improvement is needed, if
		his team is going to get better this season.

		<strong><em>2 Goals 1 Cup vs Scary FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>48.75 - 87.75</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Scary FC defeated 2 Goals 1 Cup this week to extend his winning streak
		to three straight games. His standout performer was Doherty (TOT) with
		20.25 points this week. His team's performance was fairly balanced this
		week with only two other players, Schmeichel (LEI) and Balbuena (WHU),
		scoring in double digits. Defense FC only played three defenders this
		week, but you have to say it was a smart move. Wan-Bissaka and Evans
		were on his bench and only combined for 11.5 points. Not the greatest
		week for Scary FC, but you have to be optimistic with 107.75 combined
		from the whole team, including the bench, on an off week. 2 Goals 1 Cup
		only played 6 players this week, so it's actually quite surprising he
		was able to score 48.75 points this week. His best player was Cresswell
		(WHU) with 18 points, who overall has been good since he traded Firmino
		(LIV) for him. He had two Chelsea players who also scored in double
		digits, Kovacic (CHE) and Werner (CHE). It's not good news that Kovacic
		picked up an injury as he his starting spot in the team is still not
		guaranteed in a very competitive Chelsea side. Werner's points are
		starting to pick up since he's been deployed on the left wing for
		Chelsea as he's starting to look pay back his first round draft pick
		status.
