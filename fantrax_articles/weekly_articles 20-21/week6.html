	The Premier League has definitely settled down with less goals and better
	defense as of late. However, this didn't mean there was anything short of
	drama as many matches were very close going into the last game of the week.
	Three matchups were still in the balance going into the last game of
	Tottenham vs Burnley. Two of those games kept Mourinho Out and Maximum
	Arteta top of the table, both with a record of 5-1.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Singapore Slingers vs Mourinho Out</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>64.5 - 70</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Mourinho Out defeated Singapore Slingers in a matchup that was close
		until the final game. Before the matchup, Mourinho Out and Singapore
		Slingers made a big trade. Slingers received Son (TOT) and Egan (SHU),
		while Mourinho Out received Calvert-Lewin (EVE) and Cash (AVL). Both
		Cash and Calvert-Lewin played poorly for their standards with a combined
		1.5 points between the two of them. Mourinho Out's best performer was
		Mendy (CHE), Chelsea's new goalkeeper. Mendy has gotten two clean sheets
		in a row and is looking like an excellent pickup as well as Semedo (WOL)
		who has scored 8+ points in four consecutive games. For Singapore
		Slingers, his best performance came out of Batshuayi (CRY) who scored 14
		points in his second start of the season. Going into the last game of
		the week, both teams were neck and neck. In the end it was Tottenham's
		clean sheet that won the game for Mourinho Out, as Dier (TOT) scored
		13.75 points. Had Tottenham conceded, Mourinho Out would have lost the
		matchup by 1.5 points. Looking forward it looks like Dubravka (NEW) will
		be out until December, which means Slingers can keep rolling with Darlow
		(NEW) as his goalkeeper for a while longer.

		<strong><em>PuroAme vs Scary FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>67.5 - 68.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Scary FC defeated PuroAme in the closest matchup of the week. Scary FC
		has really solidified his team as a defensive powerhouse as his top 3
		peformers were his goalkeeper and 2 defenders. However, Digne (EVE), one
		of his top defenders, received a red card in Everton's calamitous loss
		to Southampton. Digne, who is usually one of the best defenders in the
		league fantasy-wise scored -9.5 points. Scary FC won by only one point
		and can thank Chris Wood's (BUR) performance for the win, scoring 6.5
		points. 4.5 of those points came from 9 aerials from the Burnley
		forward. It was the thinnest of margins and PuroAme didn't help himself
		out. He had four players who scored 0 points with only one of them
		starting. He even had a backup to Reguilon (TOT) with Davies (TOT) who
		he could have played in the last game. For whatever reason, PuroAme
		didn't start Davies and lost the matchup. However, for PuroAme, he has
		some great potential in his team. Lookman (FUL) and Fofana (LEI) have
		both been good since he picked them up, even Fofana is not likely to
		start once Söyüncü (LEI) comes back. Also, he still has Ndidi (LEI) and
		Pereira (LEI) to come back from injury and Ziyech (CHE) looked good in
		Chelsea's 4-0 victory in the Champions League against Krasnodar.

		<strong><em>Maximum Arteta vs #TindallBall</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>66.75 - 58.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Maximum Arteta managed a narrow victory against #Tindallball with
		performances from Bruno (MUN) and Adams (SOU). Going into the last game
		of the week #TindallBall was leading by 4 points with one player left to
		go. Maximum Arteta had Brownhill (BUR) and Pope (BUR) going into the
		last game. Pope had an ok game, but it was Brownhill's 10 points that
		was really key to the victory. An early yellow card for Brownhill didn't
		stop him as he continued his good form. Brownhill has been one of
		Maximum Arteta's best pickups since the beginning of the season. One odd
		part of the matchup was actually Saiss (WOL) who scored a clean sheet
		worth 6 points, even though his team conceded a goal. Saiss played 68
		minutes for Wolves and was subbed off before Newcastle scored the
		equalizer. Quite a weird situation, that Fantrax still counts as a clean
		sheet may have been a real difference maker. Had Saiss been given a GAD
		and no clean sheet, Maximum Arteta would have still won, but only by
		0.25 points. On the other end, Maguire (MUN) had another good game,
		getting his first clean sheet of the season. #TindallBall's best
		performer was Ings (SOU) with 20.5 points including 2 assists. Ings had
		a breakout season last year, scoring 22 goals and is currently averaging
		13.1 fantasy points per game. Four players for #Tindallball didn't
		play/start for their respective teams. It would be wise for #TindallBall
		to make use of his injured reserve next week and pickup a couple more
		players to ensure his team has more options to come off the bench.

		<strong><em>Wan Young McTominaytor vs 30 Yard Screamers</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>71 - 51.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wan Young McTominaytor got another impressive victory without star
		player De Bruyne (MCI), who actually still scored 4 points without
		starting for Manchester City. McTominaytor's best peformer this week was
		actually his goalkeeper Meslier (LEE). The young french goalkeeper was
		not predicted to start the season for Leeds, but has proven to be a
		decent goalkeeper. His two other top performers are also young
		up-and-comers, Saka (ARS) and Jota (LIV). Saka was played in a front
		three for Arsenal this week and managed to be credited 6 points for a
		clean sheet, since he was subbed off before Arsenal conceded. Jota got a
		start for Liverpool this week probably thanks to the numerous injuries
		in their squad. He was able to score a goal in their win and it should
		be interesting to see if he can continue to find gametime for Liverpool.
		30 Yard Screamers didn't have many good performers this week. Costa
		(LEE) was his top scorer with 13.5 points and Henderson (LIV) put up an
		impressive 8.5 points. He'll mostly be disappointed in playing Brady,
		who didn't play for Burnley, while leaving Baldock (SHU), Antonio (WHU),
		and Reed (FUL), all of them scored 7+ points. Had 30 Yard screamers
		played all these players, would he have won his matchup? Well, if he had
		played it perfectly yes. He would have won by 3 points.

	<h2>
		<strong><em>Red Dragons vs SAMURAI BOMBER</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>101.75 - 52</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		Red Dragons won a comfortable victory over SAMURAI BOMBER with a big
		contribution from Zaha (CRY). Red Dragons is proving to not just be
		lucky this year, but that his team has actual depth. With both Aguero
		injured this week, scoring 0 points, and Vardy injured before this week
		and scoring 12 points coming off the bench. Red Dragons has had some bad
		luck with forwards, but has still managed to achieve more points than
		anyone this week. His top scorer was Zaha (CRY) with 29.5 points and he
		had 4 other players in double digits. James (CHE) hasn't managed to
		start lately, but was able to get in this week when Chelsea played a
		back 3 with James at wing back. Harrison (LEE) and Koch (LEE) both had
		exceptional games for Leeds United in their 3-0 victory against Aston
		Villa. Mata (MUN) started his second league game in a row and time will
		tell if he continues to start for Manchester United. SAMURAI BOMBER had
		some good performers this week, but was once again hurt by his team's
		lack of depth. He played two forwards, Cavani (MUN) and Vinicius (TOT),
		who didn't start for their respective teams and both gave him 0 points.
		The van Dijk (LIV) has really hurt SAMURAI BOMBER, along with some other
		players on his team that seem to be there for sentimental value. SAMURAI
		BOMBER is going to need to do some waiver wire magic in order to turn
		his season around.

		<strong><em>2 Goals 1 Cup vs So Long GAY BOiii FC</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>40 - 91.5</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		So Long GAY BOiii FC was able to get back to winning ways with a victory
		over 2 Goals 1 Cup. SLGB didn't have any real standout performers this
		week, but a combined team effort helped him towards a nice point total
		of 91.5 (third best in the league). He got double digit points from
		Klich (LEE), Saint-Maximin (NEW), Firmino (LIV), Castagne (LEI), and
		Lloris (TOT). 3 games in a row, Traore hasn't started for Wolves as he
		looks to be an impact sub for Nuno Espírito Santo. So far, in fantasy
		terms, Traore (WOL) has not been good and luckily SLGB has the squad
		depth to cover. 2 Goals 1 Cup remains bottom of the league table after
		this defeat. He now has Pulisic (CHE) and Redmond (SOU) coming back from
		injury. While Ndombele (TOT) continues to start and was 2 Goals 1 Cup's
		top performer this week.

		<strong><em>AC Aläcrân vs North London Troopz</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<h2>
		<strong><em>97.75 - 51.25</em></strong>
	</h2>
	<p>
		An amazing hattrick from Bamford (LEE) carried AC Aläcrân to a
		comfortable victory over North London Troopz. Bamford scored a season
		high 38.5 points thanks to a hattrick where all the goals came in the
		second half. Karlan Grant (WBA) a new pickup for AC Aläcrân scored 12.5
		points. North London Troopz' best performer was Zouma (CHE), which has
		been fairly common this season. His top 3 draft picks have been very
		disappointing this year and combined for a total of 12 points this week.
